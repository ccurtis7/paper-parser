A 200–300-nm-thick mesoporous TiO2 (particle size: about 50 nm, crystalline phase: anatase) film was spin-coated onto the bl-TiO2/FTO substrate using home-made pastes14 and calcining at 500 °C for 1 h in air to remove organic components. CH3NH3I (MAI) and CH3NH3Br (MABr) were first synthesized by reacting 27.86 ml CH3NH2 (40% in methanol, Junsei Chemical) and 30 ml HI (57 wt% in water, Aldrich) or 44 ml HBr (48 wt% in water, Aldrich) in a 250 ml round-bottom flask at 0 °C for 4 h with stirring, respectively. The precipitate was recovered by evaporation at 55 °C for 1 h. MAI and MABr were dissolved in ethanol, recrystallized from diethyl ether, and dried at 60 °C in a vacuum oven for 24 h. The prepared MAI and MABr powders, PbI2 (Aldrich) and PbBr2 (Aldrich) for 0.8 M MAPb(I1 − xBrx)3 (x  =  0.1–0.15) solution were stirred in a mixture of GBL and DMSO (7:3 v/v) at 60 °C for 12 h. The resulting solution was coated onto the mp-TiO2/bl-TiO2/FTO substrate by a consecutive two-step spin-coating process at 1,000 and 5,000 r.p.m for 10 and 20 s, respectively. During the second spin-coating step, the substrate (around 1 cm × 1 cm) was treated with toluene drop-casting. A detailed time-rotation profile for the spin-coating is represented in Supplementary Fig. 1c. The substrate was dried on a hot plate at 100 °C for 10 min. A solution of poly(triarylamine) (15 mg, PTAA, EM Index, Mw  =  17,500 g mol−1) in toluene (1.5 ml) was mixed with 15 μl of a solution of lithium bistrifluoromethanesulphonimidate (170 mg) in acetonitrile (1 ml) and 7.5 μl 4-tert-butylpyridine and spin-coated on the MAPb(I1 − xBrx)3 (x  =  0.1–0.15)/mp-TiO2/bl-TiO2/FTO substrate at 3,000 r.p.m for 30 s.

       "Paragraph(id='methods-content', references=[], text='A dense blocking layer of TiO2 (bl-TiO2, ∼70 nm in thickness) was deposited onto a F-doped SnO2 (FTO, Pilkington, TEC8) substrate by spray pyrolysis, using a 20 mM titanium diisopropoxide bis(acetylacetonate) solution (Aldrich) at 450 °C to prevent direct contact between the FTO and the hole-conducting layer. A 200–300-nm-thick mesoporous TiO2 (particle size: about 50 nm, crystalline phase: anatase) film was spin-coated onto the bl-TiO2/FTO substrate using home-made pastes14 and calcining at 500 °C for 1 h in air to remove organic components. CH3NH3I (MAI) and CH3NH3Br (MABr) were first synthesized by reacting 27.86 ml CH3NH2 (40% in methanol, Junsei Chemical) and 30 ml HI (57 wt% in water, Aldrich) or 44 ml HBr (48 wt% in water, Aldrich) in a 250 ml round-bottom flask at 0 °C for 4 h with stirring, respectively. The precipitate was recovered by evaporation at 55 °C for 1 h. MAI and MABr were dissolved in ethanol, recrystallized from diethyl ether, and dried at 60 °C in a vacuum oven for 24 h. The prepared MAI and MABr powders, PbI2 (Aldrich) and PbBr2 (Aldrich) for 0.8 M MAPb(I1\\xa0−\\xa0xBrx)3 (x\\xa0 = \\xa00.1–0.15) solution were stirred in a mixture of GBL and DMSO (7:3 v/v) at 60 °C for 12 h. The resulting solution was coated onto the mp-TiO2/bl-TiO2/FTO substrate by a consecutive two-step spin-coating process at 1,000 and 5,000 r.p.m for 10 and 20 s, respectively. During the second spin-coating step, the substrate (around 1 cm × 1 cm) was treated with toluene drop-casting. A detailed time-rotation profile for the spin-coating is represented in Supplementary Fig.\\xa01c. The substrate was dried on a hot plate at 100 °C for 10 min. A solution of poly(triarylamine) (15 mg, PTAA, EM Index, Mw\\xa0 = \\xa017,500 g mol−1) in toluene (1.5 ml) was mixed with 15 μl of a solution of lithium bistrifluoromethanesulphonimidate (170 mg) in acetonitrile (1 ml) and 7.5 μl 4-tert-butylpyridine and spin-coated on the MAPb(I1\\xa0−\\xa0xBrx)3 (x\\xa0 = \\xa00.1–0.15)/mp-TiO2/bl-TiO2/FTO substrate at 3,000 r.p.m for 30 s. Finally, a Au counterelectrode was deposited by thermal evaporation. The active area of this electrode was fixed at 0.16 cm2.')"
