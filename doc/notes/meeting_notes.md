# Team meeting notes

## 02/19/19, morning class discussion. 

### What will the software do ideally?

- Extract synthesis and device performance from perovskite paper(s). 

### What are the primary use cases?

- comparing different synthesis protocols for fabrication of an ideal photovoltaic device.  

### Tools to evaluate for extracting _synthesis data_ and _device performance_ from perovskite papers

- ChemDataExtractor
- ChemicalTagger

## Notes from meeting in class on 2/28/19, 03:48 PM

Deligating work; 
1. isolate relevant paragraphs (a. those containing synthesis parameters, and b. those containing performance metrics) from paper [Neel]

	2a. Given synthesis paragraph, extra parameters [Christine]
	
	2b. Given paragraph containing performance metrics, extract metrics and their relationship to specific devices/chemical-entities [Limette and Harrison]
