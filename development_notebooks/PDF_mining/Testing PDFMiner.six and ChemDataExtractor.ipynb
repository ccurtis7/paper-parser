Our first-generation devices containing\\n(PEA)2(MA)2[Pb3I10] (1; PEA = C6H5(CH2)2NH3\\n+, MA =\\nCH3NH3\\n+) show an open-circuit voltage of 1.18 V and\\na power conversion efficiency of 4.73 %. The layered structure\\nallows for high-quality films to be deposited through spin\\ncoating and high-temperature annealing is not required for\\ndevice fabrication. The 3D perovskite (MA)[PbI3] (2) has\\nrecently been identified as a promising absorber for solar cells.\\nHowever, its instability to moisture requires anhydrous proc-\\nessing and operating conditions. Films of 1 are more moisture\\nresistant than films of 2 and devices containing 1 can be\\nfabricated under ambient humidity levels. The larger bandgap\\nof the 2D structure is also suitable as the higher bandgap\\nabsorber in a dual-absorber tandem device. Compared to 2, the\\nlayered perovskite structure may offer greater tunability at the\\nmolecular level for material optimization.\\n\\nThree-dimensional (3D) hybrid perovskites of the form\\n(MA)[PbX3] (MA = CH3NH3\\n+; X = Cl, Br, or I) have recently\\nemerged as promising absorbers for solar cells.[1] The first\\nreported perovskite solar cell with (MA)[PbI3] showed\\na power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 3.81 %.[1a] Rapid\\nmaterial and device optimization has led to PCEs exceeding\\n15 % in just a few years.[2] Though progress in device\\nefficiencies has been remarkable, the lead–halide perovskites\\nhave two main drawbacks: the toxicity of the water-soluble\\nsource of\\nto\\natmospheric moisture. Recently, the lead perovskite was\\nreplaced by the significantly less toxic tin analogue in solar\\ncells with efficiencies of up to approximately 6 %.[3] However,\\nthe moisture sensitivity of the lead perovskite has not yet\\nbeen addressed. Motivated by our observations that the\\nstructurally related two-dimensional (2D) perovskites readily\\nformed high-quality films that appeared more resistant to\\nhumidity than the 3D analogues, we sought to assess if the\\n\\nlead and the instability of\\n\\nthe material\\n\\n[*] I.

Although our first-generation\\ndevices have lower efficiencies than current solar cells with\\n3D perovskite absorbers, the layered structure brings distinct\\nadvantages. In contrast to (MA)[PbI3] (2), high-quality films\\nof 1 can be obtained through one-step spin coating under\\nambient conditions without annealing. Films of 1 are also\\nmore resistant to moisture compared to 2, and devices\\ncontaining 1 can be fabricated under humid conditions.\\nImportantly, the layered structure affords greater tunability,\\nwhich may provide additional routes for material optimiza-\\ntion.\\n\\nLayered perovskites can be structurally derived from the\\n3D analogue by slicing along specific\\ncrystallographic\\nplanes.[4] The interlayer separation and thickness of the\\ninorganic layers can be controlled through the choice of\\norganic cations.[5] The inorganic layers of most\\nlayered\\nperovskites comprise a single sheet (n = 1) of corner-sharing\\nmetal–halide octahedra sandwiching layers of organic cat-\\nions.[4] These 2D materials do not have electronic properties\\ntypically associated with good solar-cell absorbers. Along with\\nlarger bandgaps compared to the 3D analogue (n =1), the\\nspatial confinement of the 2D structure and dielectric mis-\\nmatch between organic and inorganic layers lead to strongly\\nbound excitons with low mobility.[6] Such tightly bound\\nexcitons are difficult to dissociate into free carriers at room\\ntemperature and the localized charge carriers are unlikely to\\nreach the electron/hole selective contacts in a typical solar-\\ncell geometry. To access the more favorable electronic\\nproperties of the 3D structure, we sought an intermediate\\nstructure between the n = 1 and n =1 materials. We synthe-\\nsized the n = 3 member of the series (PEA)2(MA)n\\x001[PbnI3n+1]\\n(n = number of Pb–I sheets in each inorganic layer), by\\ncombining (PEA)I, (MA)I, and PbI2 in a 2:2:3 stoichiometric\\nratio in a solvent mixture of nitromethane/acetone.

The reported n = 1 and 2\\nstructures have bandgaps of 2.57 and 2.32 eV, respectively,\\nand exciton absorption bands at 2.35 and 2.15 eV, respec-\\ntively.[7] Their exciton binding energies can be estimated as\\nthe difference between bandgap and exciton absorption\\nenergies to be 220 and 170 meV for the n = 1 and 2 structures,\\n\\n11232\\n\\n\\x17 2014 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

Similar processing of\\n2 does not afford continuous films (see Figure S1 in the\\nSupporting Information). The layered structure of 1 likely\\naids film formation: unlike 2 that crystallizes as rhombic\\ndodecahedra at room temperature,[12] 1 forms plates (Fig-\\nure S2). Powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) patterns of films\\nof 1 show reflections indicating a preferential orientation of\\ncrystallites (Figure 2, top). To confirm the n = 3 perovskite\\nstructure in these films, we scraped the films into a powder,\\nloaded it into a glass capillary, and obtained unoriented\\nPXRD patterns (Figure 2, middle). These unoriented PXRD\\ndata show the reflections calculated from the single-crystal X-\\nray structure of 1 (Figure 2, bottom). The absorption spec-\\ntrum of films of 1 shows exciton absorption bands at 2.06, 2.19,\\nand 2.41 eV (Figure S4). We assign the peak at 2.06 eV to the\\n\\nFigure 2.

The peaks at 2.19 and 2.41 eV match the\\nexciton absorption energies of the n = 2 and n = 1 structures,\\nrespectively.[5c,13] These phases are not visible in the PXRD\\npatterns of films of 1, suggesting defect layers of less than n =\\n3 within the structure. Small amounts of n = 1 and 2 phases\\ncan show in the absorption spectrum because of the high\\noscillator strength of excitons in these materials.[13] Slight\\nshoulders at 1.94 and 1.87 eV may be caused by trace amounts\\nof n = 4 and 5 phases, respectively. The absorption spectrum\\ndoes not show peaks corresponding to 2 (Figure S4). When\\nexcited at 2.54 eV, the emission spectrum of 1 shows a peak at\\n1.68 eV (Figure S5). This energy lies between the emission\\nmaxima for 2D perovskites with lower values of n (n = 1 at\\n2.36 eV[13] and n = 2 at 2.15 eV[14]) and the 3D perovskite (n =\\n1 at 1.58 eV). A weak emission at 2.36 eV is likely because of\\nphotoluminescence (PL) from n = 1 layers.\\n\\nDevices utilizing 1 as the absorber were constructed\\nemploying TiO2 as the electron-selective contact and 2,2’,7,-\\n7’-tetrakis-(N,N-di-p-methoxyphenylamine)-9,9’-spirobifluor-\\nene (spiro-OMeTAD) as the hole-selective contact. Films of\\n1 were deposited from a N,N-dimethylformamide solution\\ncontaining stoichiometric quantities of PbI2, (MA)I, and\\n(PEA)I using a single spin-coating step. Importantly, devices\\ncontaining 1 can be processed in humid air, which does not\\naffect film quality or device performance. In contrast, devices\\nwith 2 must be processed under low-humidity levels for\\noptimal performance. High-quality films of 2 also require\\nhigh-temperature thermal evaporation[2b] or multistep depo-\\nsition methods, such as heat-assisted conversion of spin-\\ncoated PbI2 films to the perovskite through exposure to\\n(MA)I solution[15] or vapor,[2a] or simultaneous deposition of\\nPbCl2 and (MA)I and high-temperature annealing.[16] A\\nscanning electron microscopy (SEM) image of a fully con-\\nstructed device is shown in Figure 3 A. Typical thicknesses of\\nTiO2, 1, spiro-OMeTAD, and gold layers are 50, 425, 125, and\\n75 nm, respectively.

Owing to the larger bandgap of the 2D material, these\\nVoc values are higher than for cells containing 2 (highest\\nreported Voc = 0.924–1.07 V).[2a–c, 15] The increase in Voc value\\nof approximately 0.1 eV correlates well with the measured\\n0.1 eV increase in the peak PL energy (Figure S5), indicating\\nthat carriers are extracted from the same energy levels where\\nradiative recombination occurs.\\n\\nThe JV curve characteristics of these devices are sensitive\\nto measurement speed. Faster scan rates afforded a maximum\\ncurrent density of 11.53 mA cm\\x002, a Voc value of 1.21 V, and\\na PCE of 7.02 %, but the forward and reverse scans showed\\na large hysteresis (Figure S8). Similar effects have been\\ndetected in thin-film devices with 2.[17] To minimize these\\neffects, the current densities were measured at each voltage\\nafter a delay period (70 s) to allow the current to approach\\nsteady-state conditions (Figure S9). Even at this slow mea-\\nsurement rate, there is a slight overestimation of photocurrent\\nnear the maximum-power point as a result of slow, capacitive\\neffects. We therefore fit the data to the characteristic solar-cell\\nequation (Figure S9) in order to obtain more reliable values\\nof 0.60 for the fill factor (FF) and 4.73 % for the PCE. The\\ncurrent density under\\nis\\n6.72 mA cm\\x002. The external quantum efficiency (EQE) spec-\\ntrum matches the profile of the absorption spectrum of\\n1 (Figure S10). The integrated current\\nfrom the EQE\\nspectrum yields a net current density of 7.47 mA cm\\x002,\\ncorroborating the Jsc value obtained through steady-state\\nmeasurements. We calculate an internal quantum efficiency\\nof 70 %, assuming 10 % parasitic absorbance by non-absorber\\n\\nshort-circuit\\n\\nconditions\\n\\n(Jsc)\\n\\ncomponents of the device. This indicates that charge extrac-\\ntion could be limited, caused likely by the layered structure of\\n1, which has no direct path between adjacent inorganic layers.\\nLow-dimensional inorganic materials have previously been\\neffectively used in photovoltaic devices,[18] and device opti-\\nmization should afford improvements in Jsc values and overall\\nefficiency.\\n\\nUpon exposure to ambient humidity at room temperature,\\nopaque black films of 2 convert into a translucent yellow\\nsolid.[12b, 19] Finished devices containing 2 can be encapsulated\\nto avoid exposure to water. However, inherent stability to\\nmoisture will likely be necessary for large-scale manufacture\\nor for achieving the long lifetimes required for broad\\ncommercialization. To compare the stability of 1 and 2 to\\nmoisture, we exposed spin-coated films of both materials to\\nhumidity-controlled environments. Because direct spin coat-\\ning results in poor-quality, discontinuous films of 2 (denoted\\n2 a), we also formed higher-quality films of (MA)[PbI3]\\n(denoted 2 b) by depositing a 1:3 molar ratio of PbCl2:(MA)I\\nand annealing the films at 100 8C.[16] All films were exposed to\\na relative humidity level of 52 % for up to approximately\\n40 days and their PXRD patterns were periodically recorded\\n(Figure 4). Upon humidity exposure, the PXRD patterns of\\n\\nFigure 4. PXRD patterns of films of (PEA)2(MA)2[Pb3I10] (1), (MA)[PbI3]\\nformed from PbI2 (2 a), and (MA)[PbI3] formed from PbCl2 (2 b), which\\nwere exposed to 52 % relative humidity. Annealing of films of 2 a\\n(15 minutes) and 2 b (80 minutes) was conducted at 100 8C prior to\\nhumidity exposure. Asterisks denote the major reflections from PbI2.\\n\\n2 a and 2 b show a new phase after circa 4–5 days, which can be\\nindexed to the PXRD pattern of PbI2 (Figure S11). These new\\nreflections completely dominate the PXRD patterns after\\napproximately 40 days. Absorption spectra of 2 a and 2 b show\\na decrease in absorbance near the bandgap and an increase in\\nabsorbance above 2.4 eV (Figures S12 and 13) as the higher-\\nbandgap PbI2 phase grows as yellow patches on the films\\n(Figure S14). In contrast, the PXRD pattern of 1 does not\\nshow additional reflections over a period of 46 days of\\nhumidity exposure and the absorption spectra show no\\nsignificant changes over this time (Figure S15).\\n\\nWe show that a layered Pb–I perovskite can act as a solar-\\ncell absorber.

The\\nlayered structure of 1 aids the formation of high-quality films\\nthat show greater moisture resistance compared to 2. The\\nlarger bandgap of 1 also affords a higher VOC value of 1.18 V\\ncompared to devices with 2. Further improvements in\\nmaterial structure and device engineering, including making\\nappropriate electronic contact with the anisotropic inorganic\\nsheets, should increase the PCEs of\\nthese devices. In\\nparticular, higher values of n as single-phase materials or as\\nmixtures may allow for lower bandgaps and higher carrier\\nmobility in the inorganic layers while the organic layers\\nprovide additional\\ntunability. For example, hydrophobic\\nfluorocarbons could increase moisture stability, conjugated\\norganic layers could facilitate charge transport, and organic\\nphotosensitizers could improve the absorption properties of\\nthe material. We are focused on manipulating this extraordi-\\nnarily versatile platform through synthetic design.\\n\\nReceived: June 22, 2014\\nRevised: July 30, 2014\\nPublished online: September 1, 2014\\n\\n.Keywords: layered compounds · materials science · perovskite ·\\n\\nphotovoltaics · solar cells\\n\\n[1] a) A.
