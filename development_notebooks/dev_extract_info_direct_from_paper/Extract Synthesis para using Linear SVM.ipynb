       "['CH3NH3I (MAI) and CH3NH3Br (MABr) were first synthesized by reacting 27.86 ml CH3NH2 (40% in methanol, Junsei Chemical) and 30 ml HI (57 wt% in water, Aldrich) or 44 ml HBr (48 wt% in water, Aldrich) in a 250 ml round-bottom flask at 0 °C for 4 h with stirring, respectively.',\n",
       " 'The precipitate was recovered by evaporation at 55 °C for 1 h. MAI and MABr were dissolved in ethanol, recrystallized from diethyl ether, and dried at 60 °C in a vacuum oven for 24 h.',\n",
       " 'The resulting solution was coated onto the mp-TiO2/bl-TiO2/FTO substrate by a consecutive two-step spin-coating process at 1,000 and 5,000 r.p.m for 10 and 20 s, respectively.',\n",
       " 'During the second spin-coating step, the substrate (around 1 cm × 1 cm) was treated with toluene drop-casting.',\n",
       " 'The substrate was dried on a hot plate at 100 °C for 10 min.',\n",
       " 'A solution of poly(triarylamine) (15 mg, PTAA, EM Index, Mw\\xa0 = \\xa017,500 g mol−1) in toluene (1.5 ml) was mixed with 15 μl of a solution of lithium bistrifluoromethanesulphonimidate (170 mg) in acetonitrile (1 ml) and 7.5 μl 4-tert-butylpyridine and spin-coated on the MAPb(I1\\xa0−\\xa0xBrx)3 (x\\xa0 = \\xa00.1–0.15)/mp-TiO2/bl-TiO2/FTO substrate at 3,000 r.p.m for 30 s.',\n",
       " 'Finally, a Au counterelectrode was deposited by thermal evaporation.',\n",
       " 'The spin-coated layer formed with the solvent mixture followed by the toluene drip is extremely uniform and transparent, and covers the full surface with low surface roughness.',\n",
       " 'We see that the formation of the perovskite phase is accompanied by the complete transformation of the MAI–PbI2–DMSO at 130 °C, whereas both MAI–PbI2–DMSO and perovskite phases coexist at 100 °C.',\n",
       " 'Accordingly, the formation of the intermediate phase is a critical factor for smoothing the surface via dropwise toluene application, which finally results in compact and uniform thin layers.',\n",
       " 'Generally, the average value of the efficiency, determined from the forward and reverse scans should be widely accepted when the scanning delay time is longer than 40 ms (ref.\\xa023), because an excessively long time to complete the measurement is impractical.',\n",
       " 'For a deeper understanding of the dependence of the I–V parameters on both scan directions, we investigated the difference between the forward and reverse scans for a 40 ms scan time as a function of the thickness of the mp-TiO2 layer.']"
