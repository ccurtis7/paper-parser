       " 'The use of a mixed solvent of γ-butyrolactone and dimethylsulphoxide (DMSO) followed by toluene drop-casting leads to extremely uniform and dense perovskite layers via a CH3NH3I–PbI2–DMSO intermediate phase, and enables the fabrication of remarkably improved solar cells with a certified power-conversion efficiency of 16.2% and no hysteresis.',\n",
       " 'These results provide important progress towards the understanding of the role of solution-processing in the realization of low-cost and highly efficient perovskite solar cells.',\n",
       " 'Access provided by University of Washington',\n",
       " 'Today, crystalline silicon dominates the solar panel industry but remains relatively expensive to manufacture.',\n",
       " 'If devices could be fabricated from cheap materials by a simple solution process without annealing at high temperature, their costs could be considerably reduced through mass production.',\n",
       " 'Although dye-sensitized1, quantum dot2,3, organic4,5, and inorganic–organic heterojunction solar cells6,7 can be fabricated by multiple or single solution processes, the cells still suffer from problems such as a lack of long-term stability and low conversion efficiency due to fundamental energy losses associated with the extensive interface for charge separation.',\n",
       " 'Recently, methylammonium lead halide (MAPbX3, where MA is methylammonium CH3NH3 and X is a halogen) perovskites8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16 have offered the promise of a breakthrough for next-generation solar devices.',\n",
       " 'The use of perovskites affords several advantages: excellent optical properties that are tunable by managing chemical compositions13; ambipolar charge transport10; and very long electron–hole diffusion lengths17,18.',\n",
       " 'Perovskite materials have been applied as light absorbers to thin or thick mesoscopic metal oxides and planar heterojunction solar devices.',\n",
       " 'For example, when MAPbI3 was loaded on a mesoporous (mp)-TiO2 electrode by the sequential deposition of PbI2 and methylammonium iodide (MAI), a 15.0% power-conversion efficiency (PCE) was achieved under 1 sun illumination11.',\n",
       " 'The authors of ref.\\xa012 reported a maximum performance of 15.4% efficiency with an open-circuit voltage (Voc) of 1.07 V and short-circuit current density (Jsc) of 21.5 mA cm−2, based on uniform MAPbI3\\xa0−\\xa0xClx planar thin layers deposited by the vacuum thermal evaporation method without the mp-TiO2 electrode.',\n",
       " 'Several other groups also reported efficient planar solar cells, based on normal organic photovoltaic structure12,19.',\n",
       " 'Although very impressive cell efficiencies have been achieved, the cell architecture, use of vacuum, or the two-step deposition process should be modified to improve efficiency and reduce fabrication cost.',\n",
       " 'Spin-coating, one of the cheapest film production methods, is widely used in solution-processed perovskite solar cells.',\n",
       " 'Evaporation and the convective self-assembly process during spinning immediately induce the formation of well-crystallized perovskite materials due to strong ionic interactions between the metal cations and halogen anions.',\n",
       " 'Generally, γ-butyrolactone (GBL), N,N-dimethylformamide, DMSO and N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone are used as effective solvents for lead halides and MAI.',\n",
       " 'However, simple spin-coating did not yield a homogeneous perovskite layer having uniform thickness over a large area20, although the convective spreading flow due to centrifugal force was applied to the slowly evaporating solvents.',\n",
       " 'Previously, we reported the formation of a pillared structure with an island-type upper layer10, and proposed the importance of a homogeneous upper layer on the mp-TiO2 base; however, we were unable to deposit uniform thin films by the solution process.',\n",
       " 'This limited the applicability of the solution process.',\n",
       " 'Here, we report the solution-process fabrication of efficient perovskite solar cells comprising a bilayer architecture and MAPb(I1\\xa0−\\xa0xBrx)3 perovskites formed by a solvent-engineering technology.',\n",
       " 'The MAPb(I1\\xa0−\\xa0xBrx)3 perovskite composition was used because the substitution of 10–15 mol% Br− for I− in MAPbI3 greatly improved the stability in ambient atmosphere, and the dual halide material demonstrated similar performance over the compositional range13.',\n",
       " 'When the perovskite was deposited using a mixture of GBL and DMSO, followed by a toluene drip while spinning, extremely uniform and dense layers were formed.',\n",
       " 'This solvent-engineering technology enabled a fully solution-processed perovskite solar cell with a certified 16.2% power-conversion efficiency under standard reporting conditions.',\n",
       " 'Figure\\xa01 presents a schematic diagram of the cell architecture and deposition of perovskite materials by the solvent-engineering technology by means of spin-coating, as well as X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of the resulting coatings.',\n",
       " 'The cell architecture (Fig.\\xa01a) reveals a bilayer structure comprising mesoscopic and planar structures, and is effective for sufficiently absorbing light and collecting charges.',\n",
       " 'Atop the mp-TiO2 layer lies a highly uniform perovskite active layer (100–300 nm thick).',\n",
       " 'Poly(triarylamine) (PTAA) and Au metal were next deposited on the active layer as a hole-transporting material and photocathode, respectively.',\n",
       " 'For this architecture, the formation of a homogeneous thin perovskite layer is extremely important, and we developed our solvent-engineering technology as an effective tool for creating such a layer.',\n",
       " 'The process involves five stages, as depicted in Fig.\\xa01c.',\n",
       " 'First, a mixture of MAI, MABr, PbI2, PbBr2, GBL and DMSO in the appropriate ratio is spread over the entire surface of the substrate.',\n",
       " 'Second, the spin-coater is accelerated to the desired rotational speed and maintained there for several tens of seconds to evaporate the solvent.',\n",
       " 'Third, a solvent that does not dissolve the perovskite materials and is miscible with DMSO and GBL (for example, toluene or chloroform) is dripped on the substrate during spinning.',\n",
       " 'Fourth, all constituents are frozen into a uniform layer on the removal of the residual DMSO and then a new complex as an intermediate phase is formed (see below).',\n",
       " 'Finally, the complex is converted into highly uniform and crystalline perovskite on annealing at 100 °C for 10 min (Fig.\\xa01b).',\n",
       " 'As is apparent from Supplementary Fig.\\xa01, the morphology of the perovskite thin layer is markedly changed by this solvent-engineering process, as compared with model systems on quartz substrate.',\n",
       " 'In pure GBL, the perovskite crystals formed immediately, and the colour of the film on the substrate changed to dark hazy brown during rotation at 5,000 r.p.m, regardless of the application of the toluene drip.',\n",
       " 'The resulting morphology appears as inhomogeneous islands with low coverage on the substrate (Supplementary Fig.\\xa01a).',\n",
       " 'In contrast, in the DMSO and GBL mixed solvent, the colour change to dark brown is not observed during spin-coating, even after 5 min rotation.',\n",
       " 'The spin-coated layer formed with the solvent mixture followed by the toluene drip is extremely uniform and transparent, and covers the full surface with low surface roughness.',\n",
       " 'Without the toluene drip treatment, the resulting material adopts a textile-like inhomogeneous layer that does not fully cover the substrate, and perovskite crystals are formed from the coating after annealing at 100 °C (Supplementary Fig.\\xa01b).',\n",
       " 'Here, the crystallinity of the perovskite films is almost the same regardless of the toluene drop-casting, as can be seen in values of full-width at half-maximum of (110) XRD peaks of Supplementary Fig.\\xa02.',\n",
       " 'Therefore, the solvent-engineering technique is critically important for this process.',\n",
       " 'To gain further insight into the mixed-solvent application and subsequent toluene drip treatment, we isolated the intermediate phase formed by pouring MAI and PbI2 dissolved in GBL and DMSO into toluene.',\n",
       " 'In this experiment, we excluded the doping of MABr and PbBr2 to simplify our analysis.',\n",
       " 'The XRD profiles shown in Fig.\\xa02a imply that the resultant intermediate phase is self-organized and highly crystalline in nature.',\n",
       " 'Therefore, we think that the phase formed on toluene drop-casting in step 3 of Fig.\\xa01c has a well-developed crystalline form.',\n",
       " 'To get further information for the phase, we compared it with the XRD patterns for PbI2, MAI and PbI2(DMSO)2, because the constituents in the mixed solvent can be simply precipitated in the non-dissolving solvent.',\n",
       " 'Here, PbI2 as a layered semiconductor material contains a plane of Pb ions sandwiched between adjacent layers of hexagonally arranged iodide ions.',\n",
       " 'The interlayer spaces allow rapid intercalation of different guest molecules owing to the weak bonding between the two planes by van der Waals-type interactions, leading to the expansion of the interlayer distance along the c axis21.',\n",
       " 'It was known that the DMSO used as a solvent in this work can coordinate with lead halide to form a PbI2(DMSO)2 complex22.',\n",
       " 'However, as can be seen in the figure, the isolated powder is a new and unreported compound that cannot be assigned to reported materials, and is related to the intermediate phase formed during perovskite deposition from DMSO and GBL.',\n",
       " 'Thus, we considered a MAI–PbI2–DMSO complex as a possible crystalline compound that can be formed from the solution mixture.',\n",
       " 'In the DMSO and GBL solution mixture, GBL functions purely as a solvent, which has a relatively higher evaporation rate than DMSO during spinning; XRD patterns of the intermediate phase completely matched the material isolated from DMSO in the absence of GBL.',\n",
       " 'The mass percentage for a given element in MAI–PbI2–DMSO (C3H12NSOPbI3) requires H = 1.7%; C = 5.2%; N = 2.0%; O = 2.3%; S = 4.6%; Pb = 29.7%; and I = 54.5%.',\n",
       " 'Elemental analysis of the intermediate phase yielded the following percentages by weight: H\\xa0= 1.6%; C = 4.6%; N = 2.0%; O = 2.2%; and S = 3.7%; with a remainder of 85.9%.',\n",
       " 'If the residue is assumed to be Pb and 3I, the weight percentages of Pb and I can be determined as 30% and 55.9%, respectively.',\n",
       " 'As expected, the average atomic mass formula from elemental analysis is in agreement with MAI–PbI2–DMSO.',\n",
       " 'In addition, the intercalation of both MAI and DMSO into PbI2 can be observed by XRD peaks at low angles (6.55°, 7.21° and 9.17°).',\n",
       " 'The appearance of XRD peaks at low angles indicates that the MAI–PbI2–DMSO intermediate phase has longer interplanar distances, which are different from those in the DMSO–PbI2–DMSO complex, by the substitution of MAI for DMSO.',\n",
       " 'The presence of MAI and DMSO in PbI2 is further confirmed from the Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) spectrum for the intermediate phase.',\n",
       " 'Figure\\xa02b reveals the following spectral features and peak positions for the isolated powder; S–O and C–S stretching vibrations from DMSO coordinated to Pb2+ at 1,012 cm−1; N–H stretching in the range about 3,200–3,450 cm−1; and C–H stretching in the range about 2,800–2,950 cm−1.',\n",
       " 'The FTIR spectra of MAI, PbI2, DMSO–PbI2–DMSO, MAI–PbI2–DMSO and MAPbI3 are provided in Supplementary Fig.\\xa03 for functional group comparison.',\n",
       " 'The detection of both the N–H and S–O deformation modes in the intermediate phase guarantees the successful inclusion of a solvent molecule (DMSO) and MAI into the PbI2.',\n",
       " 'Furthermore, the C=C mode indicative of the toluene dripping solvent is not\\xa0detected.',\n",
       " 'The conversion of the intermediate phase into perovskite with annealing temperature was monitored by in situ high-temperature XRD.',\n",
       " 'The low-angle diffraction peaks in the XRD pattern of Fig.\\xa02c clearly show that, with increasing temperature, the putative MAI–PbI2–DMSO disappears and new peaks are observed due to the appearance of MAPbI3 perovskite.',\n",
       " 'On the basis of the above observations, we propose a plausible mechanism for the formation of the uniform and dense perovskite layer during spin-coating from MAI, PbI2 and DMSO with a toluene drip treatment.',\n",
       " 'Then the toluene droplets lead to the immediate freezing of the constituents on spinning via the quick removal of the excess DMSO solvent and the rapid formation of the MAI–PbI2–DMSO phase, leaving a uniform and transparent thin layer (Supplementary Fig.\\xa01d).',\n",
       " 'The role of DMSO in the MAI–PbI2–DMSO phase is to retard the rapid reaction between PbI2 and MAI during the evaporation of solvent in the spin-coating process.',\n",
       " 'Finally, the extremely homogeneous flat film (shown in Fig.\\xa03a) is converted into a pure crystalline MAPbI3 perovskite layer after annealing at 100 °C.',\n",
       " 'In this process, the key material is the flat film consisting of MAI–PbI2–DMSO.',\n",
       " 'These behaviours do not change by using the mixed-halide materials, MAPb(I1\\xa0−\\xa0xBrx)3 (x\\xa0 = \\xa00.1–0.15).',\n",
       " 'Accordingly, the formation of the intermediate phase is a critical factor for smoothing the surface via dropwise toluene application, which finally results in compact and uniform thin layers.',\n",
       " 'Figure\\xa03 illustrates images obtained by atomic force microscopy (AFM) for the intermediate film and the perovskite film on fused silica substrate, and field-emission scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images of the surface of the perovskite upper layer and the cross-section of a representative cell formed by our solvent-engineering technology.',\n",
       " 'As can be seen in the three-dimensional AFM images and topography of Fig.\\xa03a,b, the root mean square roughness values for the intermediate phase and crystalline perovskite layer are 6.0 and 8.3 nm, respectively, even though the formation of the perovskite from the intermediate layer gave slightly increased roughness.',\n",
       " 'In Fig.\\xa03c, we can observe that the surface exhibits a dense-grained uniform morphology with grain sizes in the range 100–500 nm.',\n",
       " 'The entire film is composed of a homogeneous, well-crystallized perovskite layer.',\n",

       " 'Generally, the average value of the efficiency, determined from the forward and reverse scans should be widely accepted when the scanning delay time is longer than 40 ms (ref.\\xa023), because an excessively long time to complete the measurement is impractical.',\n",
       " 'For a deeper understanding of the dependence of the I–V parameters on both scan directions, we investigated the difference between the forward and reverse scans for a 40 ms scan time as a function of the thickness of the mp-TiO2 layer.',\n",
       " 'As the layer thickness increased to \\ue429200 nm, the difference in efficiency between the forward and reverse scans reached a minimum, and then again deviated slightly with continuing mp-TiO2 thickness increases (Fig.\\xa04c).',\n",
       " 'Interestingly, the efficiency measured in the reverse scan did not vary greatly with the mp-TiO2 thickness, whereas the forward scan yielded a pronounced variation, resulting in a large discrepancy between the two scan directions.',\n",
       " 'Such a strong dependence of the measured efficiency on the scan direction with mp-TiO2 thickness suggests that solar cells fabricated from MAPbX3 perovskite materials operate differently than other types of cells such as organic, dye-sensitized, and conventional Si solar cells.',\n",
       " 'The stepwise increase or decrease in the bias voltage, corresponding to a reverse or forward scan, respectively, requires a charge redistribution to reach a new equilibrium state.',\n",
       " 'These characteristics of perovskite solar cells may be related to the large diffusion capacitance of such cells operating under reverse or forward biases24.',\n",
       " 'The large capacitance is assumed to be related to the underestimation in the forward scan and overestimation in the reverse scan by charging and discharging during the voltage sweep in the solar cells.',\n",
       " 'In other words, the generated charge (electrons or holes) may persist in the perovskite owing to the slow charge collection in the thick perovskite layer, and require significant time for charge distribution.',\n",
       " 'This would impede a quick response to the rapid scanning of the applied voltage for the I–V measurements.',\n",
       " 'Therefore, the slow charge collection via the perovskite material itself must be improved to eliminate the large discrepancy with scan direction, and an optimally thick mp-TiO2 layer must be introduced for efficient charge collection from the perovskite via the large TiO2 interface.',\n",
       " 'Eventually, it will be very important to impart effective charge collection and light absorption properties through a balance in the ratios between the perovskite-infiltrated TiO2 layer and the thin upper layers.',\n",
       " 'Of course, the tendency for discrepancy according to scan direction can be related to the perovskite composition, because the exciton diffusion length was markedly changed by doping Cl ions into MAPbI3 (ref.\\xa017).',\n",

       " 'We proposed a plausible mechanism for the formation of uniform and dense perovskite layers during the solvent-engineering process.',\n",
       " 'The formation of a stable MAI(Br)–PbI2–DMSO phase via an intercalation process during the dropwise application of a non-dissolving solvent was a decisive factor in retarding the rapid reaction between MAI(Br) and PbI(Br)2, which enabled the formation of a highly uniform and dense surface.',\n",
