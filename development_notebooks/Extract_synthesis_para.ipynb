      "We placed approximately 500 mg of CH3NH3I and 100 mg of PbCl2 into separate crucibles.\n",
      "The device substrates were placed in a substrate holder above the sources with the TiO2-coated FTO side facing down towards the sources.\n",
      "Once the pressure in the chamber was pumped down to below 10−5 mbar, the two sources were heated slightly above their desired deposition temperatures for approximately 5 min (that is, CH3NH3I was heated to about 120 °C and PbCl2 was heated to about 325 °C) to remove volatile impurities before depositing the materials onto the substrate.\n",
      "The substrate holder was rotated to ensure uniform coating throughout deposition, because the right-hand source predominantly coats the right-hand side of the substrate and similarly for the left.\n",
      "The substrate holder was water-cooled to approximately 21 °C, though precise measurement of the substrate temperature during deposition was not performed.\n",
      "Perovskite films were optimized for best device performance by varying the key deposition parameters such as the deposition rates and times for the two sources.\n",
      "In particular, device performance was very sensitive to the relative composition of CH3NH3I to PbCl2 as well as to the overall deposited thickness.\n",
      "In our trials we performed the following steps.\n",
      "(1) We varied the as-deposited composition of CH3NH3I to PbCl2 from 1:1 to 7:1, at a fixed as-annealed film thickness of 125 nm.\n",
      "(2) We varied the film thickness—at the optimum ratio of CH3NH3I:PbCl2 = 3.5:1—from 125 to 500 nm and found the optimum performance at 330 nm.\n",
      "(3) We fine-tuned the CH3NH3I:PbCl2 ratio for films with about 330 nm thickness to obtain an optimum composition of 4:1 CH3NH3I:PbCl2.\n",
      "(4) We optimized the hole-transporter thickness (solution concentration) and Li-TFSI dopant concentration to maximize performance on the ∼330-nm-thick, 4:1 CH3NH3I:PbCl2 deposited perovskite films.\n",
      "The optimal deposition rate was 5.3 Å s−1 for CH3NH3I (achieved with a crucible temperature of around 116 °C) and 1 Å s−1 for PbCl2 (achieved with a crucible temperature of around 320 °C), maintained for approximately 128 min of evaporation as shown in Extended Data Table 2.\n",
      "The colour of the samples after deposition varied depending on the composition of the two sources.\n",
      "For the best-performing devices, a reddish-brown colour was observed and the film appears to be partially crystallized in the topological SEM image of the as-deposited film, as shown in Extended Data Fig. 1.\n",
      "Annealing the as-deposited films at 100 °C for 45 min in the N2-filled glove box before spin-coating the hole transporter enabled full crystallization of the perovskite, darkening the colour and resulting in an apparent growth of the crystal features visible in the SEM image, as shown in Extended Data Fig. 1.\n",
      "After annealing, the best-performing samples had an average thickness of approximately 330 nm.\n",
      "As would be expected from the non-stoichiometric as-deposited molar ratio, there is clearly significant mass loss and hence thickness loss during perovskite film formation.\n",
      "CH3NH3SnI3−xBrx was dissolved in N,N-dimethylformamide at a weight concentration of 30% while stirring at 70 °C.\n",
      "The solution was kept at 70 °C during the whole procedure.\n",
      "The mesoporous TiO2 films were then infiltrated with CH3NH3SnI3−xBrx by spin coating at 4,000 r.p.m. for 45 s and dried at 125 °C for 30 min to remove the solvent.\n",
      "The HTM was then deposited by spin coating at 4,000 r.p.m. for 30 s.\n",
      "The spin-coating formulation was prepared by dissolving 72.3 mg spiro-OMeTAD, 30 µl 2,6-lutidine, 17.5 µl of a stock solution of 520 mg ml−1 lithium bis(trifluoromethylsulphonyl)imide in acetonitrile in 1 ml chlorobenzene.\n",
      "Finally, 100 nm of gold was thermally evaporated on top of the device to form the back contact.\n",
      "The devices were sealed in nitrogen using a 30-μm-thick hot-melting polymer and a microscope coverslip to prevent oxidation.\n",
      "Patterned transparent conducting oxide substrates were coated with a TiO2 compact layer by aerosol spray pyrolysis.\n",
      "A 350-nm-thick mesoporous TiO2 layer composed of 20-nm-sized particles was then deposited by spin coating.\n",
      "The mesoporous TiO2 films were infiltrated with PbI2 by spin-coating a PbI2 solution in DMF (462 mg ml−1) that was kept at 70 °C.\n",
      "After drying, the films were dipped in a solution of CH3NH3I in 2-propanol (10 mg ml−1) for 20 s and rinsed with 2-propanol.\n",
      "After drying, the HTM was deposited by spin-coating a solution of spiro-MeOTAD, 4-tert-butylpyridine, lithium bis(trifluoromethylsulphonyl)imide and tris(2-(1H-pyrazol-1-yl)-4-tert-butylpyridine)cobalt(iii) bis(trifluoromethylsulphonyl)imide in chlorobenzene.\n",
      "Gold (80 nm) was thermally evaporated on top of the device to form the back contact.\n",
      "For the fabrication of the best-performing devices, slightly modified conditions were used.\n",
      "First, PbI2 was spin-cast for 5 s instead of 90 s and, second, the samples were subjected to a ‘pre-wetting’ by dipping in 2-propanol for 1–2 s before being dipped in the solution of CH3NH3I and 2-propanol.\n",
      "For all measurements, devices were equipped with a 0.285-cm2 metal aperture to define the active area.\n",
      "CH3NH3I and NH2CH = NH2I were first synthesized by reacting 30 ml hydroiodic acid (57% in water, Aldrich), 27.86 ml CH3NH2 (40% in methanol, Junsei Chemical), and 15 g formamidine acetate (Aldrich) in a 250 ml round-bottomed flask at 0 °C for 2 h with stirring.\n",
      "The precipitates were recovered by evaporating the solutions at 50 °C for 1 h.\n",
      "The products were dissolved in ethanol, recrystallized using diethyl ether, and finally dried at 60 °C in a vacuum oven for 24 h.\n",
      "Similarly, CH3NH3Br and NH2CH = NH2Br were prepared using hydrobromic acid (48 wt% in water, Aldrich) according to a reported procedure27.\n",
      "The desired solutions of FAPbI3, (FAPbI3)1 − x(MAPbI3)x, (FAPbI3)1 − x(FAPbBr3)x, and (FAPbI3)1 − x(MAPbBr3)x (with x = 0–0.30) were prepared by dissolution of the CH3NH3I, CH3NH3Br, NH2CH = NH2I, and NH2CH = NH2Br powders with PbI2 (Aldrich) and PbBr2 (Aldrich) in the γ-butyrolactone:DMSO mixed solvent (7:3, volume ratio) at 60 °C for 10 min.\n",
      "The inorganic–organic lead halide perovskite solutions were then coated onto the mesoporous-TiO2/blocking-TiO2/FTO substrate by two consecutive spin-coating steps, at 1,000 rpm and 5,000 rpm for 40 s and 20 s, respectively.\n",
      "During the second spin-coating step, 1 ml toluene was poured onto the substrate, according to the procedure reported in ref. 13.\n",
      "To obtain a uniform and flat intermediate-phase film, toluene should be quickly cast in one-shot mode on a rapidly rotating (at 5,000 rpm) substrate to wash out the surplus of DMSO molecules that did not participate in the formation of the PbI2–NH2CH = NH2I–DMSO complex.\n",
      "The substrate was then dried on a hot plate at 100 °C or 150 °C for 10 min.\n",
      "A solution of PTAA (EM Index, [Mn] = 17,500 g mol−1)/toluene (10 mg ml−1) with an additive of 7.5 µl Li-bis(trifluoromethanesulphonyl) imide/acetonitrile (170 mg ml−1) and 4 µl 4-tert-butylpyridine was spin-coated on the perovskite layer/mesoporous-TiO2/blocking-TiO2/FTO substrate at 3,000 rpm for 30 s.\n",
      "Finally, an Au counter electrode was deposited by thermal evaporation; the active area of this electrode was fixed at 0.16 cm2.\n",
      "The different inorganic–organic lead halide triiodide powders were prepared by precipitation using toluene at room temperature from the desired compositional solutions obtained by dissolving CH3NH3I, CH3NH3Br, NH2CH = NH2I and NH2CH = NH2Br powders with PbI2 and PbBr2 in γ-butyrolactone.\n",
      "Solar cells were fabricated on precleaned ITO-coated glass substrates with a sheet resistance of 20 Ω sq−1.\n",
      "First, a thin ZnO nanoparticle layer was spin coated onto the substrate at 3,000 r.p.m. for 30 s.\n",
      "The procedure was repeated three times to obtain a continuous smooth film.\n",
      "A PbI2 solution (dissolved in N,N-dimethylformamide at a concentration of 460 mg ml−1) was then spin coated on top of the ZnO layer at 3,000 r.p.m. for 15 s.\n",
      "After drying for several minutes in air, the substrate was dipped into a solution of CH3NH3I in 2-propanol (10 mg ml−1) for 40 s, then dried under a flow of clean air.\n"

      "Many different photovoltaic technologies are being developed for large-scale solar energy conversion1,2,3,4.\n",
      "The wafer-based first-generation photovoltaic devices1 have been followed by thin-film solid semiconductor absorber layers sandwiched between two charge-selective contacts3 and nanostructured (or mesostructured) solar cells that rely on a distributed heterojunction to generate charge and to transport positive and negative charges in spatially separated phases4,5,6.\n",
      "Although many materials have been used in nanostructured devices, the goal of attaining high-efficiency thin-film solar cells in such a way has yet to be achieved7.\n",
      "Organometal halide perovskites have recently emerged as a promising material for high-efficiency nanostructured devices8,9,10,11.\n",
      "Here we show that nanostructuring is not necessary to achieve high efficiencies with this material: a simple planar heterojunction solar cell incorporating vapour-deposited perovskite as the absorbing layer can have solar-to-electrical power conversion efficiencies of over 15 per cent (as measured under simulated full sunlight).\n",
      "This demonstrates that perovskite absorbers can function at the highest efficiencies in simplified device architectures, without the need for complex nanostructures.\n",
      "Access provided by University of Washington\n",
      "Within a solar cell there are many different components with discrete roles and having different tolerances for purity and optoelectronic properties.\n",
      "The hybrid inorganic–organic solar cell concept is ‘material agnostic’ in that it aims to use the optimum material for each individual function.\n",
      "Any material that is easy to process, inexpensive and abundant can be used, with the aim of delivering a high-efficiency solar cell.\n",
      "Hybrid solar cells have been demonstrated in π-conjugated polymer blends containing semiconductor nanocrystals such as CdSe (ref. 12), CuInS2 (ref. 13) and PbS (ref. 14).\n",
      "Dye-sensitized solar cells are hybrid solar cells containing a mesostructured inorganic n-type oxide (such as TiO2) sensitized with an organic or metal complex dye, and infiltrated with an organic p-type hole-conductor4.\n",
      "Recently, organometal trihalide perovskite absorbers with the general formula (RNH3)BX3 (where R is CnH2n + 1, X is the halogen I, Br or Cl, and B is Pb or Sn)15, have been used instead of the dye in dye-sensitized solar cells to deliver solid-state solar cells with a power conversion efficiency of over 10% (refs 8, 11, 16).\n",
      "Evolving from the dye-sensitized solar cells, we found that replacing the mesoporous TiO2 with mesoporous Al2O3 resulted in a significant improvement in efficiency, delivering an open-circuit voltage of over 1.1 V in a device which we term a ‘meso-superstructured solar cell’8.\n",
      "We reason that this observed enhancement in open-circuit voltage is due to confinement of the photo-excited electrons within the perovskite phase, thereby increasing the splitting of the quasi-Fermi levels for electrons and holes under illumination, which is ultimately responsible for generating the open-circuit voltage.\n",
      "Further removal of the thermal sintering of the mesoporous Al2O3 layer, and better optimization of processing, has led to meso-superstructured solar cells with more than 12% efficiency17.\n",
      "In addition, CH3NH3PbI3 − xClx can operate relatively efficiently as a thin-film absorber in a solution-processed planar heterojunction solar cell configuration, delivering around 5% efficiency when no mesostructure is involved17.\n",
      "This previous work demonstrates that the perovskite absorber is capable of operating in a much simpler planar architecture, but raises the question of whether mesostructure is essential for the highest efficiencies, or whether the thin-film planar heterojunction will lead to a superior technology.\n",
      "Here, as a means of creating uniform flat films of the mixed halide perovskite CH3NH3PbI3 − xClx, we use dual-source vapour deposition.\n",
      "In Fig. 1 we show an illustration of the vapour-deposition set-up, along with an illustration of a planar heterojunction p–i–n solar cell (see Fig. 1c).\n",
      "From the bottom (the side from which the light is incident), the device is constructed on fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO)-coated glass, coated with a compact layer of n-type TiO2 that acts as the electron-selective contact.\n",
      "The perovskite layer is then deposited on the n-type compact layer, followed by the p-type hole conductor, 2,2′,7,7′-tetrakis-(N,N-di-p-methoxyphenylamine)9,9′-spirobifluorene (spiro-OMeTAD), which ensures the selective collection of holes at the silver cathode.\n",
      "Given that the purpose of this study was to understand and optimize the properties of the vapour-deposited perovskite absorber layer, the compact TiO2 and the spiro-OMeTAD hole transporter were solution-processed, as is usual in meso-superstructured solar cells17.\n",
      "In Fig. 1b, we compare the X-ray diffraction pattern of films of CH3NH3PbI3 − xClx either vapour-deposited or solution-cast onto compact TiO2-coated FTO-coated glass.\n",
      "The main diffraction peaks, assigned to the 110, 220 and 330 peaks at 14.12°, 28.44° and, respectively, 43.23°, are in identical positions for both solution-processed and vapour-deposited films, indicating that both techniques have produced the same mixed-halide perovskite with an orthorhombic crystal structure8.\n",
      "Notably, looking closely in the region of the (110) diffraction peak at 14.12°, there is only a small signature of a peak at 12.65° (the (001) diffraction peak for PbI2) and no measurable peak at 15.68° (the (110) diffraction peak for CH3NH3PbCl3), indicating a high level of phase purity.\n"

      "A diagram of the crystal structure is shown in Fig. 1d.\n",
      "The main difference between CH3NH3PbI3 and the mixed-halide perovskite presented here is evident in a slight contraction of the c axis.\n",
      "This is consistent with the Cl atoms in the mixed-halide perovskite residing in the apical positions, out of the PbI4 plane, as opposed to in the equatorial octahedral sites, as has been theoretically predicted18.\n",
      "We now make a comparison between the thin-film topology and cross-sectional structure of devices fabricated by either vapour deposition or solution processing.\n",
      "The top-view scanning electron microscope (SEM) images in Fig. 2a, b highlight the considerable differences between the film morphologies produced by the two deposition processes.\n",
      "The vapour-deposited films are extremely uniform, with what appear to be crystalline features on the length scale of hundreds of nanometres.\n",
      "In contrast, the solution-processed films appear to coat the substrate only partially, with crystalline ‘platelets’ on the length scale of tens of micrometres.\n",
      "The voids between the crystals in the solution-processed films appear to extend directly to the compact TiO2-coated FTO-coated glass.\n",
      "The cross-sectional images of the completed devices in Fig. 2c, d reveal more information about the crystal size.\n",
      "The vapour-deposited perovskite film (Fig. 2c) is uniform and similar in appearance to the FTO layer, albeit with slightly larger crystal features.\n",
      "The solution-processed perovskite film (Fig. 2d) is extremely smooth in the SEM image, consistent with much larger crystal grain size than the field of view.\n",
      "For both of these films the crystal sizes are larger than we are able to determine from the peak width of the X-ray diffraction spectra (about 400 nm), owing to machine broadening.\n",
      "On zooming out, the vapour-deposited film in Fig. 2e remains flat, having an average film thickness of approximately 330 nm.\n",
      "In contrast, the solution-processed film in Fig. 2f has an undulating nature, with film thickness varying from 50 to 410 nm.\n",
      "Notably, this cross-section is still within a single ‘platelet’, and so even greater long-range roughness occurs owing to the areas where the perovskite absorber is completely absent (a thickness variation from 0 to 465 nm was observed in multiple SEM images).\n",
      "The current-density/voltage curves measured under simulated AM1.5, 101 mW cm−2 irradiance (simulated sunlight) for the best-performing vapour-deposited and solution-processed planar heterojunction solar cells are shown in Fig. 3.\n",
      "The most efficient vapour-deposited perovskite device had a short-circuit photocurrent of 21.5 mA cm−2, an open-circuit voltage of 1.07 V and a fill factor of 0.68, yielding an efficiency of 15.4%.\n",
      "In the same batch, the best solution-processed planar heterojunction perovskite solar cell produced a short-circuit photocurrent of 17.6 mA cm−2, an open-circuit voltage of 0.84 V and a fill factor of 0.58, yielding an overall efficiency of 8.6%.\n",
      "In Table 1 we show the extracted performance parameters for these best-performing cells and the average with standard deviation of a batch of 12 vapour-deposited perovskite solar cells fabricated in an identical manner to the best-performing cell.\n",
      "Dual-source vapour deposition results in superior uniformity of the coated perovskite films over a range of length scales, which subsequently results in substantially improved solar cell performance.\n",
      "In optimizing planar heterojunction perovskite solar cells, perovskite film thickness is a key parameter.\n",
      "If the film is too thin, then that region will not absorb sufficient sunlight.\n",
      "If the film is too thick, there is a significant chance that the electron and hole (or exciton) diffusion length will be shorter than the film thickness, and that the charge will therefore not be collected at the p-type and n-type heterojunctions.\n",
      "Furthermore, the complete absence of material from some regions in the solution-processed films (pinholes) will result in direct contact of the p-type spiro-OMeTAD and the TiO2 compact layer.\n",
      "This leads to a shunting path that is probably partially responsible for the lower fill factor and open-circuit voltage in the solution-cast planar heterojunction devices17,19.\n",
      "Indeed, it is remarkable that such inhomogeneous and undulating solution-cast films can deliver devices with over 8% efficiency.\n",
      "The results presented here demonstrate that solid perovskite layers can operate extremely well in a solar cell, and in essence set a lower limit of 330 nm (the film thickness) on the electron and hole diffusion length in this perovskite absorber.\n",
      "However, more work is required to determine the electron and hole diffusion lengths precisely and to understand the primary excitation and the mechanisms for free-charge generation in these materials.\n",
      "A distinct advantage of vapour deposition over solution processing is the ability to prepare layered multi-stack thin films over large areas.\n",
      "Vapour deposition is a mature technique used in the glazing industry, the liquid-crystal display industry and the thin-film solar cell industry, among others.\n",
      "Vapour deposition can lead to full optimization of electronic contact at interfaces through multilayers with controlled levels of doping20, as is done in the crystalline silicon ‘heterojunction with thin intrinsic layer’ solar cell21 and in thin-film solar cells3.\n",
      "Additionally, organic light-emitting diodes22,23 have proved to be commercially sound, with devices with extremely thin multilayer stacks fabricated by vapour deposition.\n",
      "Small molecular organic photovoltaics have also been able to compete directly with solution-processed organic photovoltaics despite much lower levels of research and development, because with vapour deposition the charge-collection interfaces can be carefully tuned, and multi-junction architectures are more straightforward to realize24.\n",
      "An interesting possibility for the current vapour-deposited perovskite technology is to use it as a ‘top cell’ in a hybrid tandem junction with either crystalline silicon or copper indium gallium (di)selenide.\n",
      "Although ultimately an ‘all-perovskite’ multi-junction cell should be realizable, the perovskite cells have now achieved a performance that is sufficient to increase the absolute efficiency of high-efficiency crystalline silicon and copper indium gallium (di)selenide solar cells25.\n",
      "Additionally, because vapour deposition of the perovskite layers is entirely compatible with conventional processing methods for silicon-wafer-based and thin-film solar cells, the infrastructure could already be in place to scale up this technology.\n",
      "We have built vapour-deposited organometal trihalide perovskite solar cells based on a planar heterojunction thin-film architecture that have a solar-to-electrical power conversion efficiency of over 15% with an open-circuit voltage of 1.07 V.\n",
      "The perovskite absorbers seem to be versatile materials for incorporation into highly efficient solar cells, given the low-temperature processing they require, the option of using either solution processing or vapour deposition or both, the simplified device architecture and the availability of many other metal and organic salts that could form a perovskite structure.\n",
      "Whether vapour deposition emerges as the preferred route for manufacture or simply represents a benchmark method for fabricating extremely uniform films (that will ultimately be matched by solution processing) remains to be seen.\n",
      "Finally, a key target for the photovoltaics community has been to find a wider-bandgap highly efficient ‘top cell’, to enable the next step in improving the performance of crystalline silicon and existing second-generation thin-film solar cells.\n",
      "This perovskite technology is now compatible with these first- and second-generation technologies, and is hence likely to be adopted by the conventional photovoltaics community and industry.\n",
      "Therefore, it may find its way rapidly into utility-scale power generation.\n",
      "The perovskite absorber was deposited by a dual-source evaporation system (Kurt J. Lesker Mini Spectros) with ceramic crucibles (organic light-emitting diode sources) in a nitrogen-filled glovebox.\n"

      "The vapour-deposited perovskite devices were fabricated on FTO-coated glass.\n",
      "A compact layer of TiO2 was deposited on the FTO-coated glass by spin-coating (solution-processing) it with a mildly acidic solution of titanium isopropoxide in ethanol17, and subsequently the perovskite absorber was deposited on the compact TiO2-coated FTO substrate.\n",
      "Methylammonium iodide (CH3NH3I) and lead chloride (PbCl2) were the organic and inorganic precursor salts, evaporated simultaneously from separate sources at 10−5 mbar with an as-deposited molar ratio of 4:1, based on the reading of the sensors above the crucibles.\n",
      "A dark reddish-brown colour was observed immediately after evaporation.\n",
      "Annealing the perovskite absorbers before spin-coating the hole-transporter layer fully crystallized the perovskite layer.\n",
      "After spin-coating the hole transporter, spiro-OMeTAD, from a chlorobenzene solution to form the photoactive layer (including lithium bis(trifluoromethylsyfonyl)imide salt and tert-butylpyridine as additives)8, the devices were capped with silver metal electrodes through thermal evaporation at 10−6 mbar.\n",
      "Full details of material and device fabrication and characterization techniques are available in Methods.\n",
      "All other characterizations and measurements were carried out as previously described17.\n",
      "Online Content Any additional Methods, Extended Data display items and Source Data are available in the online version of the paper; references unique to these sections appear only in the online paper.\n",
      "Substrate preparation was undertaken under ambient conditions.\n",
      "TEC7 Glass FTO-coated glass (TEC7, 7 Ω/□ sheet resistivity) was patterned by etching with Zn metal powder and 2 M HCl diluted in deionized water.\n",
      "The substrates were then cleaned with a 2% solution of Hellmanex cuvette cleaning detergent diluted in deionized water, rinsed with deionized water, acetone and ethanol, and dried with clean dry air8.\n",
      "Oxygen plasma was subsequently used to treat the substrate for 10 min.\n",
      "An acidic solution of titanium isopropoxide in ethanol was spin-coated (solution-processed) onto the clean substrates at 2,000 r.p.m. for 1 min, before drying at 150 °C for 10 min and then sintering at 500 °C for 30 min to form a compact n-type layer of TiO2 (ref. 17).\n",
      "Subsequently, the perovskite absorbers were deposited through dual-source evaporation from lead chloride (PbCl2) and methylammonium iodide (CH3NH3I) simultaneously, onto the TiO2-compact-layer-coated FTO substrates under high vacuum.\n",
      "Each vapour-deposition source was monitored using a quartz crystal monitor positioned a short distance from the source.\n",
      "The source-to-monitor distance is different to the source-to-substrate distance, and so a tooling factor (which is a ratio of the material deposited on the sensors to that on the samples) was estimated for each source individually before dual-source evaporation.\n",
      "The tooling factor for both sources was initially set to 1 on the evaporator programme.\n",
      "The parameters required for estimating the thickness of the deposited material are shown in Extended Data Table 1.\n",
      "We note that the density and acoustic impedance of the CH3NH3I were unknown but both set to be 1 (the density of CH3NH3Cl has been reported as being 1.1 g cm−3 so this is probably close, and any absolute difference is accommodated by using the tooling factor).\n",
      "Initially, we ramped the temperature of each source individually, and simultaneously measured the deposition rate to gain an appreciation of the temperature range and range of deposition rates feasible for each material.\n",
      "We then chose a temperature for each material which would give a reasonable thickness of deposited material over a 30-min deposition period.\n",
      "We then carried out an evaporation of each source for a total time of approximately 30 min at a fixed evaporation rate, with the final deposited thickness recorded on the crystal monitor.\n",
      "The actual deposited thickness on the substrate we then measured with a surface profilometer and the tooling factor was estimated by dividing the sensor-estimated thickness by the measured deposited thickness on the substrate.\n",
      "The tooling results are shown in Extended Data Table 1.\n",
      "These tooling factors were then subsequently applied during co-depositions.\n",
      "The deposition rate for CH3NH3I typically varied by ±15% during an evaporation, whereas the rate for PbCl2 varied by ±10%.\n",
      "The hole-transporter layer was deposited by spin-coating (2,000 r.p.m. for 45 s) 25 μl of chlorobenzene solution that contained 61.4 mM spiro-OMeTAD, 55 mM tert-butylpyridine (tBP) and 26 mM lithium bis(trifluoromethylsyfonyl)imide salt.\n",
      "Before completing the device fabrication by the thermal evaporation of a silver cathode, the devices were left in a desiccator overnight and the unsealed devices were tested in air immediately after the cathode fabrication.\n",
      "Note that the vapour deposition of the perovskite absorbers and the spin coating of the hole transporter layer were both done in the N2-filled glove box.\n",
      "2θ scans were obtained from samples of perovskite deposited on the compact-TiO2-coated FTO-coated glass using an X-ray diffractometer (Panalytical X’Pert Pro).\n",
      "An emission SEM (Hitachi S-4300 field) was used for collecting the SEM images.\n",
      "The instrument uses an electron beam accelerated at 500 V to 30 kV, enabling operation at a variety of currents.\n",
      "Current–voltage characteristics were measured (2400 Series SourceMeter, Keithley Instruments) under simulated AM1.5 sunlight at 101 mW cm−2 irradiance generated by an Abet Class AAB Sun 2000 simulator, with the intensity calibrated with a National Renewables Energy Laboratory calibrated KG5-filtered Si reference cell (the rated error in the short-circuit photocurrent on the reference cell is 1.36% to 95% certainty).\n",
      "The mismatch factor was estimated to be less than 1%.\n",
      "The solar devices were masked with a metal aperture to define the active area of about 0.076 ± 0.002 cm−2 (error in mask area estimated from multiple measurements of a number of different masks, designed to be the same size) and measured in a light-tight sample holder to minimize any edge effects and ensure that both the reference and test cells were located in the same spot under the solar simulator during measurement.\n",

      "Lead-free solution-processed solid-state photovoltaic devices based on methylammonium tin iodide (CH3NH3SnI3) perovskite semiconductor as the light harvester are reported.\n",
      "Featuring an optical bandgap of 1.3 eV, the CH3NH3SnI3 perovskite material can be incorporated into devices with the organic hole-transport layer spiro-OMeTAD and show an absorption onset at 950 nm, which is significantly redshifted compared with the benchmark CH3NH3PbI3 counterpart (1.55 eV).\n",
      "Bandgap engineering was implemented by chemical substitution in the form of CH3NH3SnI3–xBrx solid solutions, which can be controllably tuned to cover much of the visible spectrum, thus enabling the realization of lead-free solar cells with an initial power conversion efficiency of 5.73% under simulated full sunlight.\n",
      "Further efficiency enhancements are expected following optimization and a better fundamental understanding of the internal electron dynamics and corresponding interfacial engineering.\n",
      "The reported CH3NH3SnI3–xBrx perovskite solar cells represent a step towards the realization of low-cost, environmentally friendly solid-state solar cells.\n",
      "Access provided by University of Washington\n",
      "The development of clean alternatives to current power generation methods is immensely important to preserving the global environment and assuring sustained economic growth1.\n",
      "The recent emergence of halide perovskites as light harvesters and hole-transport materials has revolutionized the emerging photovoltaic technologies2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14.\n",
      "Organic–inorganic hybrid perovskite compounds based on metal halides adopt the ABX3 perovskite structure.\n",
      "This structure consists of a network of corner-sharing BX6 octahedra, where the B atom is a metal cation (typically Sn2+ or Pb2+) and X is typically F−, Cl−, Br− or I−.\n",
      "The A cation is selected to balance the total charge and it can even be a Cs+ or a small molecular species15,16,17.\n",
      "Recent implementation of CH3NH3PbX3 (X = I, Cl, Br) perovskite absorbers with the organic hole conductor 2,2′,7,7′-tetrakis-(N,N-di-p-methoxyphenylamine)9,9′-spirobifluorene (spiro-OMeTAD) enabled power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) greater than 15% (refs 8,18), and has been recognized as the ‘next big thing in photovoltaics’19,20,21,22.\n",
      "A planar heterojunction photovoltaic device incorporating vapour-deposited perovskite (CH3NH3PbI3−xClx) as the absorbing layer has demonstrated overall PCEs of over 15% with a high open-circuit voltage of up to 1.07 V, further highlighting the industrial application potential of this configuration in the near future7.\n",
      "Recent studies have indicated that mixed-halide organic–inorganic hybrid perovskites can display electron–hole diffusion lengths of over 1 µm, which is consistent with our reports of very high carrier mobilities in these materials23 and supports our expectations for highly efficient and cheap solar cells using thick absorption layers24,25.\n",
      "However, to realize commercial applications of this technology it is important to reach analogous optical and photovoltaic performance using lead-free organic–inorganic compounds.\n",
      "Here, we report a first attempt using the lead-free perovskite of methylammonium tin iodide (CH3NH3SnI3) as the light-absorbing material to fabricate solution-processed solid-state photovoltaic devices.\n",
      "Featuring an even lower optical bandgap of 1.3 eV than the 1.55 eV achieved with CH3NH3PbI3, devices with CH3NH3SnI3 in conjunction with an organic spiro-OMeTAD hole-transport layer showed an absorption onset of 950 nm.\n",
      "Further chemical alloying of iodide with bromide provides efficient energetic tuning of the band structure of the perovskites, leading to a PCE of 5.8% under simulated full sunlight of 100 mW cm−2.\n",
      "Building on this very promising initial result and with further reduction of interfacial losses, we believe a substantial increase in efficiency can be achieved.\n",
      "As shown in Fig. 1a,b, CH3NH3SnI3 adopts the perovskite structure type, crystallizing in the pseudocubic space group P4mm at ambient conditions.\n",
      "Unlike CH3NH3PbI3, which has a lower symmetry at room temperature (β-phase), the Sn analogue adopts its highest symmetry phase (α-phase), even at room temperature.\n",
      "The corner-sharing [SnI6]4− polyhedra form an infinite three-dimensional lattice with Sn–I–Sn connecting angles of 177.43(1)° and 180° for the a- and c-axes, respectively.\n",
      "The deviation from the ideal cubic (Pm–3m) structure arises from orientational polarization of the CH3NH3+ cation along the C–N bond direction, which is imposed on the three-dimensional [SnI3]− inorganic lattice coinciding with the crystallographic c-axis23.\n",
      "CH3NH3SnI3 is a direct-gap semiconductor with an energy gap of 1.3 eV, as has been shown experimentally and theoretically23,26.\n",
      "The optical bandgap Eg of the CH3NH3SnI3 compound (determined from diffuse reflectance measurements) is shown in Fig. 1c.\n",
      "The optical absorption coefficient (α/S) is calculated using reflectance data according to the Kubelka–Munk equation27, α/S = (1 − R)2/2R, where R is the percentage of reflected light, and α and S are the absorption and scattering coefficients, respectively.\n",
      "At room temperature, the material displays a strong photoluminescence emission at 950 nm, which corresponds to the onset of the absorption edge (Fig. 1c).\n",
      "The photoluminescence intensity can act as a qualitative measure of the number of photogenerated carriers in semiconductors, as it is proportional to the number of e−h+ pairs produced by the incident light28.\n",
      "As depicted in Fig. 1d, its bulk electrical conductivity σ is ∼5 × 10−2 S cm−1 at room temperature, corresponding to a Seebeck coefficient of ∼−60 µV K−1 (n-type).\n",
      "The compound has a low carrier concentration on the order of ∼1 × 1014 cm−3 and high electron mobilities (μe) on the order of ∼2,000 cm2 V−1 s−1, which is comparable or even superior to most traditional semiconductors, including Si, CuInSe2 and CdTe, which have comparable bandgap energies.\n",
      "The doping level of CH3NH3SnI3 can be varied greatly depending on the preparation method.\n",
      "Carrier concentrations up to 1 × 1019 cm−3 have been reported for CH3NH3SnI3 (ref. 29), showing a strong p-type character and a metallic behaviour suggestive of a heavily doped semiconducting behaviour.\n"

      "We attribute this large difference in the transport properties to Sn4+ impurities that are inherently present in commercial SnI2, which are readily detectable by a mass loss at ∼150 °C via thermal gravimetric analysis (Supplementary Fig. 1).\n",
      "Therefore, when assembling the solar cells, care must be taken in depositing films of tin perovskite with low carrier concentration to maximize the carrier mobility within the active perovskite layer.\n",
      "This means that excessive Sn4+ in the sample must be avoided.\n",
      "The valence band maximum (EVB) of the CH3NH3SnI3 compound was determined from ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS) measurements.\n",
      "A representative UPS spectrum for the CH3NH3SnI3 is shown in Supplementary Fig. 2, where the energy is calibrated with respect to the He I photon energy (21.21 eV).\n",
      "The valence band energy EVB is estimated to be ∼−5.47 eV below vacuum level, which is close to the reported value for CH3NH3PbI3 (−5.43 eV)5.\n",
      "From the observed optical bandgap, the conduction band energy ECB of CH3NH3SnI3 was determined to be at ∼−4.17 eV, that is, slightly higher than the ECB for the TiO2 anatase electrode (−4.26 eV)5.\n",
      "To fabricate the solid-state solar cells, mesoporous anatase TiO2 films were prepared by spin coating a solution of colloidal anatase particles (20 nm in size) onto a 30-nm-thick compact TiO2 underlayer30.\n",
      "The underlayer was deposited by atomic layer deposition on a pre-patterned transparent-conducting-oxide-coated glass substrate acting as the electric front contact of the solar cell.\n",
      "Deposition of the perovskite light-absorbing layer was carried out by spin coating in a nitrogen glove box to avoid hydrolysis and oxidation of the tin perovskite in contact with air.\n",
      "The triarylamine derivative 2,2′,7,7′-tetrakis-(N,N-di-p-methoxyphenylamine)-9,9′-spirobifluorene (spiro-OMeTAD)31 was then applied as a hole-transporting material (HTM) on top of the mesoporous TiO2 and perovskite layer.\n",
      "Lithium bis(trifluoromethylsulphonyl)imide and 2,6-lutidine were added in the HTM solution as important dopants to increase the hole mobility31.\n",
      "Figure 2 shows a representative cross-sectional scanning electron microscopy (SEM) image of a typical solar cell device.\n",
      "The mesoporous TiO2 film had an average thickness of ∼350 nm and was infiltrated with the perovskite nanocrystals using the spin-coating procedure.\n",
      "The HTM penetrates into the remaining pore volume of the perovskite/TiO2 layer and forms a 200-nm-thick capping layer on top of the composite structure.\n",
      "A thin gold layer was thermally evaporated under high vacuum onto the HTM layer, forming the back contact electrode of the device.\n",
      "The solid-state device based on the CH3NH3SnI3 perovskite shows a high mean short-circuit photocurrent density Jsc of 16.30 mA cm−2, an open-circuit voltage Voc of 0.68 V and a moderate fill factor (FF) of 0.48 under AM 1.5G solar illumination, corresponding to a PCE of 5.23% (Fig. 3a).\n",
      "This high current density was achieved with submicrometre-thick TiO2 films (that is, 350 nm) because of the large optical absorption cross-section of the perovskite material and the well-developed interfacial pore filling by the hole conductor (Fig. 2).\n",
      "More importantly, the incident photon-to-electron conversion efficiency (IPCE) of the CH3NH3SnI3-based device covers the entire visible spectrum and reaches a broad absorption maximum of over 60% from 600 nm to 850 nm.\n",
      "It is accompanied with a notable absorption onset up to 950 nm (Fig. 3b), which is in good agreement with the optical bandgap of ∼1.30 eV.\n",
      "Integrating the overlap of the IPCE spectrum with the AM 1.5G solar photon flux yields a current density of 16.60 mA cm−2, which is in excellent agreement with the measured photocurrent density.\n",
      "This confirms that any mismatch between the simulated sunlight and the AM 1.5G standard is negligibly small.\n",
      "It is important to note that, although the obtained Jsc for the CH3NH3SnI3 perovskite device is less efficient than that for the CH3NH3PbI3 device7,8,18,32, the maximum current density that can be generated exceeds 30 mA cm−2 when integrating the AM 1.5G solar spectrum below the bandgap of CH3NH3SnI3 perovskite (1.30 eV).\n",
      "To figure out the limiting factor for the fair photocurrent density, devices with thinner active layer thickness (∼150 nm) were constructed and tested.\n",
      "As shown in Supplementary Fig. 3, a Jsc of ∼12 mA cm−2 was achieved, with a Voc of 0.74 V and a FF of 0.45, thus generating a PCE of 4.44%.\n",
      "Accordingly, the diffusion length of the tin perovskite might not be a main limiting factor for device performance24,25.\n",
      "The film morphology and quality of the spin-coated CH3NH3SnI3 film were then investigated by SEM (Supplementary Fig. 4).\n",
      "Poor film quality and coverage of the tin perovskite on the mesoporous TiO2 electrodes were observed, which has recently been recognized as an important factor determining perovskite solar cell performance8,13.\n",
      "Future device optimization will therefore focus on the improvement of perovskite film quality and interfacial recombination inhibition.\n",
      "It has recently been observed that the charge accumulates in high density in the perovskite absorber material rather than only in the semiconducting TiO2 electrodes, making this type of photovoltaic device fundamentally different from dye-sensitized solar cells33.\n",
      "Thus, the Voc in a perovskite solar cell is not only related to the energy difference between the HTM potential and the TiO2 conduction bandedge, but could also be correlated with the energy difference between the HTM potential and the conduction bandedge of the perovskite itself.\n",
      "From the abovementioned band alignment it can be inferred that the conduction bandedge ECB of CH3NH3SnI3 is ∼0.24 eV lower than in CH3NH3PbI3, thus leading to a lower Voc for the CH3NH3SnI3 perovskite device.\n",
      "Therefore, in an attempt to increase the Voc of these lead-free devices, chemical substitution of the iodide atom with bromide was applied in order to favourably tune the bandgap energetics32.\n",
      "The CH3NH3SnI3−xBrx compounds were prepared by mixing stoichiometric amounts of CH3NH3X and SnX2 (X = Br, I), finely homogenized in a mortar in the nitrogen glove box.\n",
      "The resulting solids were sealed in silica ampules under 1 × 10−4 mbar vacuum and heated to 200 °C to complete the reaction.\n",
      "As shown by the X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns in Fig. 4a, this series of compositions forms a continuous solid solution throughout the composition range, without displaying any structural transitions (at room temperature), thus retaining the crystal structure of both end members, crystallizing at the P4mm space group.\n",
      "The properties of the solid solutions are clearly displayed by a continuous contraction of the lattice parameters from the CH3NH3SnI3 to CH3NH3SnBr3 end members, which results in a widening of the bandgap (Table 1).\n",
      "To check the optical properties in the hybrid halide perovskite, ultraviolet–visible diffuse reflectance spectra of CH3NH3SnI3−xBrx (x = 0, 1, 2, 3) were measured and transformed to absorption spectra, as mentioned above.\n",
      "Figure 4b shows that the absorption onset of CH3NH3SnI3−xBrx (x = 0, 1, 2, 3) hybrid halide perovskites can be tuned from 954 nm (1.30 eV for CH3NH3SnI3) to 577 nm (2.15 eV for CH3NH3SnBr3), thus resulting in significant colour tunability for perovskite photovoltaic devices (as shown in the right panel of Fig. 2).\n",
      "The intermediate iodide/bromide hybrid perovskites of CH3NH3SnI2Br and CH3NH3SnIBr2 show absorption onsets of 795 nm (1.56 eV) and 708 nm (1.75 eV), respectively.\n",
      "The valence band energy EVB of the CH3NH3SnI3−xBrx compounds was also estimated from the UPS measurements.\n",
      "As illustrated in Fig. 4c, the ECB increased from –4.17 eV below vacuum level for CH3NH3SnI3 to −3.96 eV for CH3NH3SnI2Br and −3.78 eV for CH3NH3SnIBr2, and finally to −3.39 eV for CH3NH3SnBr3.\n",
      "It is obvious from the band alignment diagram that the change in the bandgap Eg of the CH3NH3SnI3−xBrx compounds is mainly due to the conduction band shift to higher energy, with the valence band energy remaining practically unchanged.\n"

      "These changes in energy levels allow for bandgap engineering and the tuning of energetics for more efficient solar cell architectures.\n",
      "Figure 3a,b presents representative photocurrent density–voltage (J–V) characteristics and IPCE spectra for devices constructed with the CH3NH3SnI3−xBrx perovskites as light harvesters.\n",
      "The photovoltaic parameters are summarized in Table 1.\n",
      "As demonstrated in the right panel of Fig. 2, through the chemical compositional control of CH3NH3SnI3−xBrx, the corresponding device colour can be tuned from black for CH3NH3SnI3 to dark brown for CH3NH3SnI2Br and to yellow for CH3NH3SnBr3 with increasing Br content.\n",
      "Notably, Jsc decreased from 16.30 mA cm−2 for CH3NH3SnI3 to 8.26 mA cm−2 for CH3NH3SnBr3 with increasing Br content, whereas Voc increased from 0.68 V to 0.88 V when switching from the pure iodide to pure bromide perovskite.\n",
      "In addition to the significant improvement in Voc, an increase in FF from 0.48 to 0.59 was also observed upon the incorporation of the Br ions.\n",
      "Amongst the investigated CH3NH3SnI3−xBrx perovskites, the device with CH3NH3SnIBr2 delivered the highest PCE of 5.73%, with a Jsc of 12.30 mA cm−2, a Voc of 0.82 V and a FF of 0.57.\n",
      "The reduction of Jsc with increasing Br content is directly related to the blueshift of absorption onset, as indicated from the IPCE spectra in Fig. 3b.\n",
      "Consistent with the bandgap tuning, the onset of the IPCE spectra blueshifted from 950 nm for the iodide perovskite to ∼600 nm for the pure bromide perovskite.\n",
      "Integrating the overlap of these IPCE spectra with the AM 1.5G solar photon flux yields a current density Jcal that is similar to the measured photocurrent density Jsc (Table 1).\n",
      "The improvement in Voc can be attributed to the raised conduction bandedge ECB with increasing Br content in CH3NH3SnI3−xBrx.\n",
      "However, the FF is significantly lower than the reported values for high-efficiency perovskite solar cells7,8,18.\n",
      "It is well recognized that series resistance Rs is one of the major factors influencing the FF of solar cells.\n",
      "This arises mainly from three factors: (1) the active and interfacial layer resistances, (2) electrode resistance and (3) contact resistance.\n",
      "In the present work, variations in Rs among the cells with CH3NH3SnI3−xBrx perovskites will be mainly caused by differences in the active layer resistance, because factors (2) and (3) will be similar, being common in all of our devices.\n",
      "We estimated Rs from the slope of the J–V curve at the open-circuit voltage point.\n",
      "As shown in Table 1, the Rs value decreased from 105 Ω for a device with CH3NH3SnI3 to 60.98 Ω for CH3NH3SnBr3, which is in accordance with the observed FF enhancement from 0.48 to 0.59.\n",
      "Another important issue that needs to be specified is that insufficient coverage of the perovskite film (Supplementary Fig. 4) might result in a high frequency of shunt paths allowing direct contact between the HTM and the TiO2 compact layer, which will act as a parallel diode in the device, deteriorating the FF and Voc (ref. 34).\n",
      "Further FF improvements are expected from more efficient interfacial engineering to inhibit back electron recombination.\n",
      "An important issue to note for the tin perovskite solar cell is the well-known poor atmospheric stability of the Sn-based perovskite compared to its lead analogy16,21,35.\n",
      "We carried out a preliminary stability investigation of the CH3NH3SnI3 perovskite solar cell by storing the devices in a nitrogen glove box after sealing with Surlyn films.\n",
      "Encouragingly, the devices retained almost 80% of the initial performance in the first 12 h (Supplementary Table 1).\n",
      "Performance loss arises mainly from the decrease in photocurrent density and FF, primarily due to the p-type doping via Sn2+ oxidation induced during the fabrication process.\n",
      "Far better stability can be expected if more advanced sealing techniques are adopted.\n",
      "In summary, methylammonium tin halide perovskites (CH3NH3SnI3−xBrx) have been used as lead-free light harvesters for solar cell applications for the first time.\n",
      "Featuring an ideal optical bandgap of 1.3 eV, devices with CH3NH3SnI3 perovskite together with an organic spiro-OMeTAD hole-transport layer showed a notable absorption onset up to 950 nm, which is significantly redshifted compared with its benchmark CH3NH3PbI3 counterpart (1.55 eV).\n",
      "The bandgap engineering of CH3NH3SnI3−xBrx perovskites can be controllably tuned to cover much of the visible spectrum, thus enabling the realization of lead-free, colourful solar cells and leading to a promising initial PCE of 5.73% under simulated full sunlight.\n",
      "Further efficiency enhancements would be expected by the fundamental understanding of the internal electron dynamics and corresponding interfacial engineering.\n",
      "The reported CH3NH3SnI3−xBrx perovskites are believed to represent a significant step towards the realization of low-cost, high-efficiency, environmentally benign, next-generation solid-state solar cells.\n",
      "Unless stated otherwise, all materials were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich and used as received.\n",
      "Spiro-OMeTAD was purchased from Merck KGaA.\n",
      "CH3NH3I, CH3NH3Br and SnI2 were synthesized and purified according to a reported procedure23.\n",
      "CH3NH3SnI3−xBrx compounds were prepared by mixing stoichiometric amounts of CH3NH3X and SnX2 (X = Br, I), finely homogenized in a mortar in a nitrogen glove box.\n",
      "The resulting solids were sealed in quartz ampules under 1 × 10−4 mbar vacuum and heated to 200 °C to complete the reaction23.\n",
      "Optical diffuse-reflectance measurements were performed at room temperature using a Shimadzu UV-3101 PC double-beam, double-monochromator spectrophotometer operating from 200 nm to 2,500 nm.\n",
      "BaSO4 was used as a non-absorbing reflectance reference.\n",
      "Photoluminescence spectra were measured with an OmniPV photoluminescence system, equipped with a diode-pumped frequency-doubled Nd:YAG laser (500 mW power output, class 4) emitting at 532 nm coupled with a bundle of eight 400-μm-core optical fibres as an excitation source.\n",
      "Resistivity measurements were made for arbitrary current directions in the a–b plane using a standard point contact geometry.\n",
      "A homemade resistivity apparatus was used that was equipped with a Keithley 2182A nanovoltometer, Keithley 617 electrometer, Keithley 6220 Precision d.c. source and a high-temperature vacuum chamber controlled by a K-20 MMR system.\n",
      "Seebeck measurements were performed on the same homemade apparatus using Cr/Cr:Ni thermocouples as electric leads, which were attached to the sample surface by means of colloidal graphite isopropanol suspension.\n",
      "The temperature gradient along the crystal was generated by a resistor on the ‘hot’ side of the crystal.\n",
      "The data were corrected for the thermocouple contribution using a copper wire.\n",
      "SEM and energy-dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) measurements were performed with a Hitachi SU8030 scanning electron microscope equipped with an Oxford X-max 80 SDD EDS detector.\n",
      "Data were acquired with an accelerating voltage of 15 kV.\n",
      "A fluorine-doped tin oxide-coated glass substrate (Tec15, Hartford Glass) was patterned by etching with Zn metal powder and 2 M HCl diluted in deionized water.\n",
      "The substrates were then cleaned by ultrasonication with detergent, rinsed with deionized water, acetone and ethanol, and dried with clean dry air.\n",
      "A 30-nm-thick TiO2 compact layer was deposited on the substrates by an atomic layer deposition system (Savannah S300, Cambridge Nanotech) using titanium isopropoxide (TTIP) and water as precursors.\n",
      "The mesoporous TiO2 layer composed of 20-nm-sized particles was deposited by spin coating at 4,500 r.p.m. for 30 s using a hydrothermal-synthesized TiO2 paste diluted in ethanol (1:4, weight ratio).\n",
      "After drying at 125 °C, the TiO2 films were gradually heated to 500 °C, baked at this temperature for 15 min, and then cooled to room temperature (25 °C).\n",
      "After cooling to room temperature, the substrates were treated in a 0.02 M aqueous solution of TiCl4 for 30 min at 70 °C, rinsed with deionized water, and dried at 500 °C for 20 min.\n",
      "Before use, the films were again dried at 500 °C for 30 min.\n"

      "Following pioneering work1, solution-processable organic–inorganic hybrid perovskites—such as CH3NH3PbX3 (X = Cl, Br, I)—have attracted attention as light-harvesting materials for mesoscopic solar cells2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15.\n",
      "So far, the perovskite pigment has been deposited in a single step onto mesoporous metal oxide films using a mixture of PbX2 and CH3NH3X in a common solvent.\n",
      "However, the uncontrolled precipitation of the perovskite produces large morphological variations, resulting in a wide spread of photovoltaic performance in the resulting devices, which hampers the prospects for practical applications.\n",
      "Here we describe a sequential deposition method for the formation of the perovskite pigment within the porous metal oxide film.\n",
      "PbI2 is first introduced from solution into a nanoporous titanium dioxide film and subsequently transformed into the perovskite by exposing it to a solution of CH3NH3I.\n",
      "We find that the conversion occurs within the nanoporous host as soon as the two components come into contact, permitting much better control over the perovskite morphology than is possible with the previously employed route.\n",
      "Using this technique for the fabrication of solid-state mesoscopic solar cells greatly increases the reproducibility of their performance and allows us to achieve a power conversion efficiency of approximately 15 per cent (measured under standard AM1.5G test conditions on solar zenith angle, solar light intensity and cell temperature).\n",
      "This two-step method should provide new opportunities for the fabrication of solution-processed photovoltaic cells with unprecedented power conversion efficiencies and high stability equal to or even greater than those of today’s best thin-film photovoltaic devices.\n",

      "The underlayer was deposited by aerosol spray pyrolysis on a transparent-conducting-oxide-coated glass substrate acting as the electric front contact of the solar cell.\n",
      "Lead iodide (PbI2) was then introduced into the TiO2 nanopores by spin-coating a 462 mg ml−1 (∼1 M) solution of PbI2 in N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF) kept at 70 °C.\n",
      "The use of such a high PbI2 concentration is critical to obtaining the high loading of the mesoporous TiO2 films required to fabricate solar cells of the highest performance.\n",
      "Further experimental details are provided in Methods.\n",
      "Figure 1a presents a cross-sectional scanning electron microscopy (SEM) image of the thus-prepared film.\n",
      "The absence of any PbI2 crystals protruding from the surface of the mesoporous anatase layer shows that our infiltration method leads to a structure in which the PbI2 is entirely contained within the nanopores of the TiO2 film.\n",
      "Dipping the TiO2/PbI2 composite film into a solution of CH3NH3I in 2-propanol (10 mg ml−1) changes its colour immediately from yellow to dark brown, indicating the formation of CH3NH3PbI3.\n",
      "We monitored the dynamics of the formation of the perovskite by optical absorption, emission and X-ray diffraction (XRD) spectroscopy.\n",
      "Figure 1b shows that the increase over time of the perovskite absorption at 550 nm is practically complete within a few seconds of exposing the PbI2-loaded TiO2 film to the CH3NH3I solution.\n",
      "A small additional increase in the absorbance, occurring on a timescale of 100 s and contributing only a few per cent to the total increase of the signal, is attributed to morphological changes producing enhanced light scattering.\n",
      "The conversion is accompanied by a quenching of the PbI2 emission at 425 nm (Fig. 1c) and a concomitant increase in the perovskite luminescence at 775 nm (Fig. 1d).\n",
      "The latter emission passes through a maximum before decreasing to a stationary value.\n",
      "This decrease results from self-absorption of the luminescence by the perovskite formed during the reaction with CH3NH3I.\n",
      "The traces were fitted to a biexponential function yielding the decay times stated in Fig. 1b–d.\n",
      "We note that the increase in the emission intensity before the quenching in Fig. 1c is an optical artefact that results from opening the sample compartment to add the CH3NH3I solution.\n",
      "The green and red curves in Fig. 1e show X-ray powder diffraction spectra measured before and, respectively, after the TiO2/PbI2 nanocomposite film is brought into contact with the CH3NH3I solution.\n",
      "For comparison, we spin-coated the PbI2 also on a flat glass substrate and exposed the resulting film to a CH3NH3I solution in the same manner as the TiO2/PbI2 nanocomposite.\n",
      "On the basis of literature data, the PbI2 deposited by spin-coating from DMF solution crystallizes in the form of the hexagonal 2H polytype, the most common PbI2 modification (Inorganic Crystal Structure Database, collection code 68819; http://www.fiz-karlsruhe.com/icsd.html).\n",
      "Moreover, the results show that on a flat glass substrate, crystals grow in a preferential orientation along the c axis, hence the appearance of only four diffraction peaks, corresponding to the (001), (002), (003) and (004) lattice planes (Fig. 1e, black curve).\n",
      "For the PbI2 loaded on a mesoporous TiO2 film (Fig. 1e, green curve), we find three additional diffraction peaks that do not originate from TiO2, suggesting that the anatase scaffold induces a different orientation for the PbI2 crystal growth.\n",
      "The peaks labelled (2) and (3) in Fig. 1e can be attributed to the (110) and (111) lattice planes of the 2H polytype.\n",
      "Peak (1) is assigned to a different PbI2 variant, whose identification is beyond the scope of this report in view of the large number of polytypes that have been reported for PbI2 (ref. 16).\n",
      "During the reaction with CH3NH3I, we observe the appearance of a series of new diffraction peaks that are in good agreement with literature data on the tetragonal phase of the CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite17.\n",
      "However, when PbI2 is deposited on a flat film (Fig. 1e, blue curve) the conversion to perovskite on exposure to the CH3NH3I solution is incomplete; a large amount of unreacted PbI2 remained even after a dipping time of 45 min.\n",
      "This agrees with the observation that the CH3NH3I insertion hardly proceeds beyond the surface of thin PbI2 films, and that the complete transformation of the crystal structure requires several hours18.\n",
      "A caveat associated with such long conversion times is that the perovskite dissolves in the methylammonium iodide solution over longer periods, hampering the transformation.\n",
      "In striking contrast to the behaviour of thin films of PbI2 deposited on a flat support, the conversion of PbI2 nanocrystals in the mesoporous TiO2 film is practically complete on a timescale of seconds, as is evident from the immediate disappearance of its most intense diffraction peak (the (001) peak) and the concomitant appearance of the XRD reflections for the tetragonal perovskite.\n",
      "When the PbI2 crystals are contained within the mesoporous TiO2 scaffold, their size is limited to ∼22 nm by the pore size of the host.\n",
      "Notably, we find that confining the PbI2 crystals to such a small size drastically enhances their rate of conversion to perovskite, which is complete within a few seconds of their coming into contact with the methylammonium iodide solution.\n",
      "However, when deposited on a flat surface, larger PbI2 crystallites in the size range of 50–200 nm are formed, resulting in incomplete conversion of the PbI2 on exposure to CH3NH3I, as shown by XRD.\n",
      "The SEM images of such a film that are depicted in Supplementary Fig. 1e, f show, however, that the perovskite produced by the sequential deposition technique adopts a morphology similar to that of the PbI2 precursor.\n",
      "Supplementary Fig. 1 also shows that large crystals of CH3NH3PbI3 with a wide range of sizes are formed when the perovskite is deposited in a single step from a solution of CH3NH3I and PbI2 in γ-butyrolactone or DMF.\n",
      "A key finding of the present work is that the confinement of the PbI2 within the nanoporous network of the TiO2 film greatly facilitates its conversion to the perovskite pigment.\n",
      "Moreover, the mesoporous scaffold of the host forces the perovskite to adopt a confined nanomorphology.\n",
      "The literature contains several examples in which a two-step procedure is used to fabricate nanostructures that are not easily, or not at all, accessible by a direct synthetic route.\n",
      "Ion exchange reactions have, for example, been used to convert dispersed II–V semiconductor nanocrystals into the corresponding III–V analogues while preserving particle size and distribution as well as the initial nanomorphology19,20,21.\n",
      "As reported, the thermodynamic driving force of such a reaction is the difference in bulk lattice energy for the two materials, and the initial crystal lattice serves as a template for the formation of the desired compound.\n",
      "As for PbI2, the insertion of the organic cation is facilitated through the layered PbI2 structure, which consists of three spatially repeating planes, I–Pb–I (ref. 16).\n",
      "Numerous literature reports show that strong intralayer chemical bonding, as well as only weak interlayer van der Waals interactions, allows the easy insertion of guest molecules between these layers22,23,24.\n",
      "In our case, the large energy of formation of the hybrid perovskite, combined with the nanoscopic morphology of the PbI2 precursor, which greatly enhances the reaction kinetics, finally enables the transformation to be completed within seconds.\n",
      "We used the sequential deposition technique to fabricate mesoscopic solar cells employing the triarylamine derivative 2,2′,7,7′-tetrakis(N,N-di-p-methoxyphenylamine)-9,9′-spirobifluorene (spiro-MeOTAD) (Supplementary Fig. 2) as a hole-transporting material (HTM).\n",
      "We note that, following a recently reported concept25, we use a Co(iii) complex as a p-type dopant for the HTM at a molar doping level of 10% to ensure a sufficient conductivity and low series resistance.\n",

      "The mesoporous TiO2 film had an optimized thickness of around 350 nm and was infiltrated with the perovskite nanocrystals using the above-mentioned two-step procedure.\n",
      "The HTM was subsequently deposited by spin coating.\n",
      "It penetrates into the remaining available pore volume and forms a 100-nm-thick layer on top of the composite structure.\n",
      "A thin gold layer was thermally evaporated under vacuum onto the HTM, forming the back contact of the device.\n",
      "We measured the current density (J)–voltage (V) characteristics of the solar cells under simulated air mass 1.5 global (AM1.5G) solar irradiation and in the dark.\n",
      "Figure 3a shows J–V curves measured at a light intensity of 95.6 mW cm−2 for a typical device.\n",
      "From this, we derive values for the short-circuit photocurrent (Jsc), the open-circuit voltage (Voc) and the fill factor of, respectively, 17.1 mA cm−2, 992 mV and 0.73, yielding a solar-to-electric power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 12.9% (Table 1).\n",
      "Statistical data on a larger batch of ten photovoltaic devices is shown in Supplementary Table 1.\n",
      "From the average PCE value of 12.0% ± 0.5% and the small standard deviation, we infer that photovoltaics with excellent performance and high reproducibility can be realized using the method reported here.\n",
      "Figure 3b shows the incident-photon-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE), or external quantum efficiency, spectrum for the perovskite cell.\n",
      "Generation of photocurrent starts at 800 nm, in agreement with the bandgap of the CH3NH3PbI3, and reaches peak values of over 90% in the short-wavelength region of the visible spectrum.\n",
      "Integrating the overlap of the IPCE spectrum with the AM1.5G solar photon flux yields a current density of 18.4 mA cm−2, which is in excellent agreement with the measured photocurrent density, extrapolated to 17.9 mA cm−2 at the standard solar AM1.5G intensity of 100 mW cm−2.\n",
      "This confirms that any mismatch between the simulated sunlight and the AM1.5G standard is negligibly small.\n",
      "Comparison with the absorptance or light-harvesting efficiency (LHE) depicted in Fig. 3c reveals that the low IPCE values in the range of 600–800 nm result from the smaller absorption of the perovskite in this spectral region.\n",
      "This is also reflected in the spectrum of the internal quantum efficiency, or absorbed-photon-to-current conversion efficiency (APCE), which can be derived from the IPCE and LHE and is shown in Fig. 3d.\n",
      "The APCE is greater than 90% over the whole visible region, without correction for reflective losses, indicating that the device achieves near-unity quantum yield for the generation and collection of charge carriers.\n",
      "In an attempt to increase the loading of the perovskite absorber on the TiO2 structure and to obviate the lack of absorption in the long-wavelength region of the spectrum, we slightly modified the conditions for the deposition of the PbI2 precursor as well as the transformation reaction.\n",
      "Details are provided in Methods.\n",
      "The J–V characteristics of the best-performing cell of the series that was fabricated in this manner are depicted in Fig. 3e.\n",
      "From this data, we derive values of 20.0 mA cm−2, 993 mV and 0.73 for Jsc, Voc and the fill factor, respectively, yielding a PCE of 15.0% measured at a light intensity of Pin = 96.4 mW cm−2.\n",
      "To the best of our knowledge, this is the highest power conversion efficiency reported so far for organic or hybrid inorganic–organic solar cells and one of the highest for any solution-processed photovoltaic device.\n",
      "Several solar cells with PCEs between 14% and 15% were fabricated.\n",
      "One of these devices was sent to an accredited photovoltaic calibration laboratory for certification, confirming a power conversion efficiency of 14.14% measured under standard AM1.5G reporting conditions.\n",
      "Detailed photovoltaics data for this device can be found in Supplementary Fig. 3.\n",
      "Compared with the devices from which we took the data shown in Fig. 3a and Supplementary Table 1, these top-performance devices benefit from a significantly higher photocurrent.\n",
      "We attribute this trend to the increased loading of the porous TiO2 film with the perovskite pigment and to increased light scattering, improving the long-wavelength response of the cell.\n",
      "The increase in light scattering is likely to result from the additional pre-wetting step that was used for the top-performance devices.\n",
      "The pre-wetting locally decreases the methylammonium iodide concentration, inducing the growth of larger crystals.\n",
      "Detailed studies that aim to identify the key role of the different parameters during the sequential deposition are ongoing.\n",
      "To test the stability of the perovskite-based photovoltaics prepared using the aforementioned procedure, we subjected a sealed cell to long-term light soaking at a light intensity of ∼100 mW cm−2 and a temperature of 45 °C.\n",
      "The device was encapsulated under argon and maintained at the optimal electric power output during the ageing using maximum-power-point tracking.\n",
      "We found a very promising long-term stability: the photovoltaic device maintained more than 80% of its initial PCE after a period of 500 h (Supplementary Fig. 4).\n",
      "Also, it is notable that we do not observe any change in the short-circuit photocurrent, indicating that there is no photodegradation of the perovskite light harvester.\n",
      "The decrease in PCE is therefore due only to a decrease in both the open-circuit potential and the fill factor, and the similar shape of the two decays suggests that they are linked to the same degradation mechanism.\n",
      "The change in these two parameters is mainly due to a decrease in the shunt resistance, as is apparent from Supplementary Fig. 5, where J–V curves of the device before and after the ageing process are shown.\n",
      "The sequential deposition method for the fabrication of perovskite-sensitized mesoscopic solar cells introduced here provides a means to achieve excellent photovoltaic performance with high reproducibility.\n",
      "The power conversion efficiency of 15% achieved with the best device is amongst the highest for solution-processed photovoltaics and sets a new record for organic or hybrid inorganic–organic solar cells in general.\n",
      "Our findings open new routes for the fabrication of perovskite-based photovoltaic devices, because other preformed metal halide mesostructures may be converted into the desired perovskite by the simple insertion reaction detailed here.\n",
      "On the basis of our results, we believe that this new class of mesoscopic solar cells will find widespread application and will eventually lead to devices that rival conventional silicon-based photovoltaics.\n",
      "Devices were sealed in argon and subjected to constant light soaking at approximately 100 mW cm−2 using an array of light-emitting diodes.\n",
      "During the testing, the devices were maintained at their maximum power point and a temperature of about 45 °C.\n",

      "Of the many materials and methodologies aimed at producing low-cost, efficient photovoltaic cells, inorganic–organic lead halide perovskite materials1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17 appear particularly promising for next-generation solar devices owing to their high power conversion efficiency.\n",
      "The highest efficiencies reported for perovskite solar cells so far have been obtained mainly with methylammonium lead halide materials1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10.\n",
      "Here we combine the promising—owing to its comparatively narrow bandgap—but relatively unstable formamidinium lead iodide (FAPbI3) with methylammonium lead bromide (MAPbBr3) as the light-harvesting unit in a bilayer solar-cell architecture13.\n",
      "We investigated phase stability, morphology of the perovskite layer, hysteresis in current–voltage characteristics, and overall performance as a function of chemical composition.\n",
      "Our results show that incorporation of MAPbBr3 into FAPbI3 stabilizes the perovskite phase of FAPbI3 and improves the power conversion efficiency of the solar cell to more than 18 per cent under a standard illumination of 100 milliwatts per square centimetre.\n",
      "These findings further emphasize the versatility and performance potential of inorganic–organic lead halide perovskite materials for photovoltaic applications.\n",
      "Access provided by University of Washington\n",
      "An inorganic–organic lead halide perovskite is any material that crystallizes into an AMX3 (where A is an organic ammonium cation, M is Pb or Sn, and X is a halide anion) structure.\n",
      "The size of cation A is critical for the formation of a close-packed perovskite structure; in particular, cation A must fit into the space composed of four adjacent corner-sharing MX6 octahedra.\n",
      "Of the various inorganic–organic lead halide perovskite materials, methylammonium lead iodide (MAPbI3), with a bandgap of about 1.5–1.6 eV and a light absorption spectrum up to a wavelength of 800 nm, has been extensively used as a light harvester in solar cells.\n",
      "Several methods, including a one-step spin-coating method1,2,3,6, a two-step sequential method4, and vapour deposition in a high-vacuum chamber5, have been used to prepare MAPbI3 materials.\n",
      "Additionally, different device architectures such as planar5,10 and mesostructured cells1,7 have also been proposed.\n",
      "The highest power conversion efficiency8,9,11 (PCE) so far, of 16% to 17%, was achieved for solution-processed MAPbI3, although 19.3% in a planar device architecture was recently obtained from a reverse-bias current–voltage (I–V) curve12.\n",
      "We note that a PCE measured13,14,15 via a reverse-bias scan with the solar cells exhibiting a large-hysteresis I–V curve can be highly overestimated.\n",
      "We have already showed that chemical modification of the X site anions (for example, substitution of I with Br) of MAPbI3 can tune the bandgaps to range between 1.5 eV and 2.3 eV by incorporating MAPbBr3 (2.3 eV bandgap); this resulted in colour variation and PCE modulation6.\n",
      "In contrast, HC(NH2)2PbI3, which contains formamidinium (FA) cations instead of methylammonium (MA) cations at the ‘A’ site of the AMX3 perovskite structure, has a bandgap of 1.48 eV, with an absorption edge of 840 nm (refs 16, 17, 18).\n",
      "We expect that this reduced bandgap may allow absorption of photons over a broader solar spectrum.\n",
      "The structural and opto-electrical differences of MAPbI3 and FAPbI3 are likely to originate from the difference in ionic radius of the MA (1.8 Å) and FA ions (1.9–2.2 Å).\n",
      "In fact, the relative ionic radii of A, M and X in the AMX3 perovskite structure have been widely used as a method of establishing the distortion of the MX6 octahedron; in particular, a relatively smaller ion radius for X favours the formation of cubic structures18.\n",
      "However, the photovoltaic performance of FAPbI3 has been reported to be lower than that of MAPbI3 (refs 16, 17).\n",
      "In addition, the black perovskite-type polymorph (α-phase), which is stable at relatively high temperatures (above 160 °C), was observed to turn into the yellow FAPbI3 polymorph (δ-phase) in an ambient humid atmosphere17.\n",
      "However, considering their suitable bandgap (which is lower than that in MAPbI3), the performance of FAPbI3 solar cells can be considerably improved by stabilizing the FAPbI3 phase, improving the crystallinity, and optimizing the cell architecture.\n",
      "In this regard, Pellet et al.19 demonstrated an improved PCE using mixed cation lead iodide perovskites by gradually substituting MA with FA cations—which increases the absorption range by shifting it redwards, allowing for a higher current density—but the performance was still dominated by MAPbI3 rather than FAPbI3.\n",
      "We have recently reported a 16.2% certified PCE obtained from the combination of MAPbI3 and MAPbBr3 with a bilayer architecture consisting of perovskite-infiltrated mesoporous-TiO2 electrodes, and an extremely uniform and dense upper perovskite layer obtained by solvent engineering techniques13; the absorption edge was below 770 nm.\n",
      "A strategy for extending the absorption range of solar light is thus to replace MAPbI3 with FAPbI3 in the combined composition of MAPbI3 and MAPbBr3.\n",
      "Here we report the overall PCE and structural stability of (FAPbI3)1 − x(MAPbBr3)x, with the mole ratio x ranging between 0 and 0.3.\n",
      "We investigated the performance of systems containing different amounts of MAPbBr3 incorporated into FAPbI3—that is, (FAPbI3)1 − x(MAPbBr3)x—by measuring their current density versus voltage (J−V).\n",
      "Figure 1a shows the PCEs obtained from the J−V curves for different (FAPbI3)1 − x(MAPbBr3)x systems under standard air-mass 1.5 global (AM1.5G) illumination.\n"

      "The PCEs were averaged from the reverse (from the open-circuit voltage Voc to the short-circuit current Isc) and forward (from Isc to Voc) sweeps, because perovskite solar cells may experience a dependence of the measured efficiency on the scan direction.\n",
      "However, the hysteresis of the cells fabricated from FAPbI3 and FAPbI3 incorporating 15 mol% MAPbBr3 was not relevant, even after collecting J−V curves with the relatively short scanning delay time of 40 ms (Fig. 1b).\n",
      "In addition, the small discrepancies related to the scan direction for the FAPbI3/MAPbBr3 systems disappeared at longer delay times (above 100 ms).\n",
      "That the hysteresis observed in FAPbI3-based systems is negligible compared to the hysteresis in MAPbI3 (Fig. 1b inset) may be related to the balance between electron and hole transport within the perovskite layer.\n",
      "As reported, the electron-diffusion length in MAPbI3 (∼130 nm) is 1.4 times larger than the hole-diffusion length (∼90 nm)20, while FAPbI3 has a hole-diffusion length (∼813 nm) that is 4.6 times longer than the electron-diffusion length (∼177 nm)16.\n",
      "In addition, Kanatzidis et al.18 showed, by measuring the Seebeck coefficient, that MAPbI3 and FAPbI3 display an n-type and a p-type character, respectively.\n",
      "Since the incident light of the FTO/TiO2/perovskite/PTAA/Au (where FTO is fluorine-doped tin oxide and PTAA is poly(triarylamine)) cell configuration reaches the perovskite through the FTO side, more carriers are generated on the perovskite near TiO2 than on the perovskite near PTAA.\n",
      "Therefore, many more holes than electrons should travel a long distance through the perovskite layer to the PTAA layer.\n",
      "This indicates that the balance between electron and hole transport in cells should be considered in compositional engineering for highly efficient perovskite solar cells.\n",
      "Data in Table 1 show that the solar cell annealed at 100 °C with x = 0 exhibits considerably low Jsc, Voc and fill factor (FF) values.\n",
      "In contrast, the overall PCE, including Jsc, Voc and FF, noticeably increased when annealing was performed at 150 °C.\n",
      "The trend of PCE as a function of x in the cells fabricated with FAPbI3–MAPbBr3 showed that Jsc increases from 19.0 mA cm−2 (at x = 0.05) to a maximum value of 22 mA cm−2 (at x = 0.15); after this point, Jsc decreases to 20 mA cm−2 (at x = 0.30).\n",
      "In this range, Voc increases from 1.0 V to 1.12 V.\n",
      "Interestingly, the FF showed exactly the same Jsc behaviour with a maximum value of 73% at x = 0.15.\n",
      "The ultraviolet–visible absorption spectra displayed in Fig. 1c show a systematic shift of the absorption band edge to shorter wavelengths when the MAPbBr3 content is increased.\n",
      "The reduction of Jsc observed with x larger than 0.15 is directly related to the blue-shift of absorption onset, which in turn is responsible for the reduced light-harvesting efficiency.\n",
      "As expected, the external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectrum shown in Fig. 1d is blue-shifted when x is increased, resulting in the reduction of Jsc.\n",
      "However, a relatively lower Jsc, below x = 0.15, indicates that the charge-collection efficiency is also low, because Jsc is proportional to the product of the charge-collection efficiency and the light-harvesting efficiency.\n",
      "The fact that the FF has a trend similar to that of Jsc supports this, as confirmed by the considerably high series resistance shown below x = 0.15 (with annealing at 100 °C).\n",
      "The increase of Voc over the entire range studied in this work may be attributed to the widening of the bandgap, which occurs when x increases.\n",
      "Most importantly, the PCE of the solar cells fabricated in this study exhibits a maximum value of 17.3% at x = 0.15, owing to the simultaneous enhancement of Jsc and FF, while Voc continues to increase (because the PCE is determined from the products of Jsc, Voc and FF).\n",
      "To further elucidate possible reasons for such low values of Jsc and FF below x = 0.15, we examined the phase stability of FAPbI3.\n",
      "It is known that FAPbI3 is characterized by a reversible phase transition between two polymorphs, that is, a black perovskite with trigonal symmetry (space group P3m1) and a yellow non-perovskite with hexagonal symmetry (P63mc)17,18.\n",
      "The latter contains linear chains of [PbI6] octahedrons with face-sharing, while the former consists of a three-dimensional network of corner-sharing octahedrons.\n",
      "Figure 2a shows the results of the differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and thermogravimetric analysis of a yellow FAPbI3 powder heated at 300 °C.\n",
      "An endothermic peak around 160 °C was found with the DSC analysis, which appears without any weight loss up to 250 °C in the thermogravimetric analysis.\n",
      "The X-ray diffraction (XRD) spectra of the yellow powder measured in situ (Extended Data Fig. 1) suggest that the endothermic peak can be assigned to the phase transition from yellow non-perovskite to black perovskite, in agreement with previous studies16,21.\n",
      "This indicates that the yellow non-perovskite phase for the pure FAPbI3 material is likely to be thermodynamically stable.\n",
      "This phase transition was also found to be reversible in air, that is, the prepared yellow non-perovskite phase changed to the black perovskite phase when annealing was performed at 170 °C; the black powder turned yellow again after being stored in air for 10 days (Extended Data Fig. 2).\n",
      "This unintentional phase transition in FAPbI3 solar cells may reduce the photovoltaic performance, because the yellow phase is characterized by a large optical bandgap (Fig. 1c) and an inferior charge-transporting ability due to the linear chain-like [PbI6] octahedron structure.\n",
      "Notably, AMX3 (where A is Rb, Cs, MA or FA, M is Pb or Sn, and X is Cl, Br or I) metal trihalide materials exist as either two polymorphs (perovskite and non-perovskite) or only one of the two, depending on the atomic size of the components22.\n",
      "For example, in contrast to CsSnI3, which has two polymorphs, MASnI3, with larger MA+ cations, shows only a perovskite phase and no phase transition near room temperature (∼25 °C).\n",
      "RbSnI3, with smaller Rb+ cations, shows only a non-perovskite phase22,23,24.\n",
      "Therefore, the atomic combination of the A and X sites may lead to the stabilization of the FAPbI3 perovskite structure.\n",
      "Figure 2b shows the XRD spectra of the prepared FAPbI3, (FAPbI3)1 − x(MAPbI3)x, (FAPbI3)1 − x(FAPbBr3)x, and (FAPbI3)1 − x(MAPbBr3)x films (with x = 0.15) on mesoporous-TiO2/blocking-TiO2/FTO glass substrates, after annealing at 100 °C for 10 min; these were prepared using the solvent-engineering process with precursor solutions of the desired compositions as previously reported13.\n",
      "The XRD spectrum of the pure FAPbI3 thin film shows the typical diffraction pattern of a hexagonal non-perovskite polymorph of FAPbI3 (P63mc)18; this can be detected from DSC (Fig. 2a), because the temperature of the annealing (100 °C) is much lower than the temperature (160 °C) at which the phase transition occurs.\n",
      "However, when FA+ cations in FAPbI3 are substituted by 15 mol% of MA+ cations, a strong (111) diffraction peak at 13.9° for the trigonal perovskite phase (P3m1) appears in spite of the annealing at 100 °C.\n",
      "The same diffraction peaks are also observed in systems containing Br− ions (15 mol%), although the secondary phase coexists in the film.\n",
      "Surprisingly, a simultaneous introduction of 15 mol% of both MA+ cations and Br− anions in FAPbI3 to obtain (FAPbI3)0.85(MAPbBr3)0.15 leads to a synergetic effect that stabilizes the perovskite phase.\n",
      "Interestingly, this is sufficient to form a FAPbI3 perovskite phase even after incorporating 5 mol% of MAPbBr3 (Extended Data Fig. 3), although the single MA+ or Br− can only partially form a perovskite phase.\n",
      "We also found that a highly crystalline perovskite layer is formed with values of x larger than 0.15, according to the full width of half maximum (FWHM) of the (−111) diffraction peak (Fig. 2c).\n",
      "Therefore, we surmise that the enhancement of the phase stability and crystallinity results in an improvement of PCE in the x range of 0 to 0.15.\n"

      "The perovskite phase stabilization caused by the introduction of MAPbBr3 to FAPbI3 was also confirmed by an analysis carried out on the synthesized powders, which were prepared at room temperature by precipitation from solutions of FAPbI3, (FAPbI3)1 − x(MAPbI3)x, (FAPbI3)1 − x(FAPbBr3)x, and (FAPbI3)1 − x(MAPbBr3)x with x = 0.15.\n",
      "Photographs of the as-prepared powders shown in Extended Data Fig. 4 indicate that a black powder like as-prepared MAPbI3 is obtained only for (FAPbI3)0.85(MAPbBr3)0.15.\n",
      "In addition, the XRD spectra of the powders revealed that (FAPbI3)0.85(MAPbBr3)0.15, in contrast to FAPbI3, shows a pure perovskite phase (Extended Data Fig. 5), with no endothermic DSC peaks (Fig. 2a).\n",
      "This finding confirms that the co-substitution of MA to FA and Br to I can efficiently stabilize the perovskite phase.\n",
      "However, further investigation is required to determine the energetics of the perovskite and non-perovskite formation and to establish the composition of the stable form in perovskite halide materials.\n",
      "We recently successfully fabricated a complete bilayer on a mesoporous-TiO2 using the solvent-engineering technology; our findings confirmed that surface coverage and morphology of perovskite materials is critical13.\n",
      "For this reason, here we analysed the surfaces deposited with different x values for MAPbBr3/FAPbI3 using the solvent-engineering process.\n",
      "Figure 2d shows the surface scanning electron microscope (SEM) images of (FAPbI3)1 − x(MAPbBr3)x, with x = 0, 0.05 and 0.15, on a 200-nm-thick mesoporous-TiO2/blocking-TiO2/FTO annealed for 10 min at 150 °C (x = 0) and 100 °C, respectively.\n",
      "Our results showed that the surface of FAPbI3 exhibits an irregular morphology with bumpy roughness.\n",
      "Incorporating MAPbBr3 into FAPbI3 (with x = 0.15) considerably smoothed the surface; however, systems characterized by x = 0.05 still presented large voids between crystal boundaries.\n",
      "The rough surface of FAPbI3 may be due to the transition from non-perovskite to perovskite phases and to the high temperature required for the formation of the perovskite phase.\n",
      "Indeed, manipulating the composition of FAPbI3 by adding MAPbBr3 led to the stabilization of the perovskite phase with a uniform and dense morphology as well as well-developed crystallites, which are responsible for the highly improved cell performance.\n",
      "On the basis of these results, we repeated the fabrication procedure, fixing x to a value of 0.15 to enhance further the performance of the FAPbI3-MAPbBr3 system with an architecture as follows: FTO/blocking-TiO2 (70 nm)/mesoporous-TiO2:perovskite composite layer (200 nm)/perovskite upper layer (300 nm)/PTAA (50 nm)/Au (100 nm).\n",
      "Of the devices obtained, Fig. 3a shows the J–V curves measured via reverse and forward bias sweep for one of the best-performing solar cells.\n",
      "The Jsc, Voc and FF values averaged from the J–V curves of this device are 22.5 mA cm−2, 1,105 mV and 73.2%, respectively; these correspond to a PCE of 18.4% under standard AM1.5G conditions.\n",
      "The PCE value is in agreement with that obtained from the stabilized power output near the maximum power point, reflecting the device performance in the working condition more closely (Extended Data Fig. 6).\n",
      "In the case of the cell using thinner mesoporous-TiO2 layer (80 nm), as shown in Extended Data Fig. 7, although an unprecedented PCE of 20.3% was measured via reverse bias scan, the PCE of around 17.3% obtained from an average J–V curve and steady-state current measurement is far lower than that from the best cell using a 200-nm-thick mesoporous-TiO2 layer, owing to the low PCE of 15.5% with forward bias scan.\n",
      "This result is similar to those of ref. 12 and implies that substantial PCE values should be obtained from J–V curves averaged with reverse and forward bias sweep.\n",
      "Figure 3b shows the EQE spectrum for one of the best-performing solar cells.\n",
      "A very broad EQE plateau of over 80% between 400 nm and 750 nm was observed.\n",
      "The Jsc value integrated from EQE was found to be in good agreement with that measured by J–V.\n",
      "The highly performing devices exhibiting PCEs of 18.0% with very small hysteresis was certified by the standardized method in the photovoltaic calibration laboratory, confirming a PCE of 17.9% under AM1.5G full sun (Extended Data Fig. 8).\n",
      "To the best of our knowledge, such a PCE value is the highest ever reported for a perovskite-based solar cell, excluding the value overestimated by reverse bias scan.\n",
      "We have described the compositional engineering of (FAPbI3)1 − x(MAPbBr3)x for efficient perovskite solar cells.\n",
      "(FAPbI3)0.85(MAPbBr3)0.15 has many advantages over other systems such MAPbI3, FAPbI3, and MAPb(I0.85Br0.15)3.\n",
      "This strategy may lead to more efficient and cost-effective inorganic–organic hybrid perovskite solar cells.\n",

      "The TiO2 nanoparticles used in the paste were prepared by hydrothermal treatment at 250 °C for 12 h from aqueous solutions of the peroxotitanium complex, as described elsewhere25,26.\n",
      "The peroxotitanium complex solutions were synthesized via a reaction between hydrogen peroxide and the TiO(OH)2 wet cake.\n",
      "The wet cake was obtained by the dropwise addition of a NH4OH solution into 0.33M TiOCl2 aqueous solution obtained by the hydrolysis of TiCl4.\n",
      "The resulting cake was purified by repeated washing with deionized water until no Cl− ions were detected.\n",
      "Then, 200 ml of 35 wt% hydrogen peroxide was added into 300 ml of a 2 wt% TiO(OH)2-dispersed aqueous solution such that the H2O2/Ti4+ ratio was ∼40; the solution was constantly stirred in an ice bath.\n",
      "Once the addition of H2O2 was completed, the colour of the precipitate changed from white to turbid yellowish, and finally light orange- or reddish-coloured transparent solutions were formed within 1 h.\n",
      "The TiO2-nanoparticle (average diameter 50 nm, anatase) slurry obtained by the hydrothermal treatment was stirred for 1 h, while several drops of concentrated nitric acid were added to obtain a colloidal dispersion solution.\n",
      "Then the TiO2 nanoparticles were collected by the centrifugal method.\n",
      "The TiO2 wet cake was re-dispersed and centrifuged in absolute ethanol by ultrasonic irradiation.\n",
      "The process with absolute ethanol was repeated for three cycles.\n",
      "The collected TiO2 nanoparticles were dispersed in 100 ml of absolute ethanol, 4.5 g (per 1 g of TiO2) of a 10 wt% ethanolic solution of ethyl cellulose (Fluka, 46070), and 4.4 g (per 1 g of TiO2) of terpineol.\n",
      "After the addition of each component, the mix was stirred for 10 min and homogenized by ultrasonic irradiation.\n",
      "The paste was finally produced by a three-roller-mill grinder (EXAKT) after concentrating the mixture solution in a rotary evaporator.\n",
      "A dense blocking layer of TiO2 (60 nm, blocking-TiO2) was deposited onto an F-doped SnO2 (FTO, Pilkington, TEC8) substrate by spray pyrolysis using a 20 mM titanium diisopropoxide bis(acetylacetonate) solution (Aldrich) at 450 °C; this was done to prevent a direct contact between FTO and the hole-conducting layer.\n",
      "A 200-nm-thick mesoporous-TiO2 was spin-coated onto the blocking-TiO2/FTO substrate using TiO2 pastes diluted in 2-methoxyethanol (1 g in 5 ml) and calcinated at 500 °C for 1 h in air to remove the organic components.\n",
      "The XRD spectra of the prepared films were measured using a Rigaku SmartLab X-ray diffractometer; the in situ XRD experiment of the as-prepared FAPbI3 yellow powder was performed using a Rigaku Ultima IV with an X-ray tube (Cu Kα, wavelength λ = 1.5406 Å).\n",
      "Ultraviolet–visible absorption spectra were recorded on a Shimadzu UV 2550 spectrophotometer in the 300–800 nm wavelength range at room temperature.\n",

       " 'Two different cell structures, based on mesoscopic metal oxides and planar heterojunctions have already demonstrated very impressive advances in performance.',\n",
       " 'Here, we report a bilayer architecture comprising the key features of mesoscopic and planar structures obtained by a fully solution-based process.',\n",
       " 'We used CH3NH3 Pb(I1\\xa0−\\xa0xBrx)3 (x\\xa0 = \\xa00.1–0.15) as the absorbing layer and poly(triarylamine) as a hole-transporting material.',\n",
       " 'The use of a mixed solvent of γ-butyrolactone and dimethylsulphoxide (DMSO) followed by toluene drop-casting leads to extremely uniform and dense perovskite layers via a CH3NH3I–PbI2–DMSO intermediate phase, and enables the fabrication of remarkably improved solar cells with a certified power-conversion efficiency of 16.2% and no hysteresis.',\n",
       " 'These results provide important progress towards the understanding of the role of solution-processing in the realization of low-cost and highly efficient perovskite solar cells.',\n",
       " 'Access provided by University of Washington',\n",
       " 'Today, crystalline silicon dominates the solar panel industry but remains relatively expensive to manufacture.',\n",
       " 'If devices could be fabricated from cheap materials by a simple solution process without annealing at high temperature, their costs could be considerably reduced through mass production.',\n",
       " 'Although dye-sensitized1, quantum dot2,3, organic4,5, and inorganic–organic heterojunction solar cells6,7 can be fabricated by multiple or single solution processes, the cells still suffer from problems such as a lack of long-term stability and low conversion efficiency due to fundamental energy losses associated with the extensive interface for charge separation.',\n",
       " 'Recently, methylammonium lead halide (MAPbX3, where MA is methylammonium CH3NH3 and X is a halogen) perovskites8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16 have offered the promise of a breakthrough for next-generation solar devices.',\n",
       " 'The use of perovskites affords several advantages: excellent optical properties that are tunable by managing chemical compositions13; ambipolar charge transport10; and very long electron–hole diffusion lengths17,18.',\n",
       " 'Perovskite materials have been applied as light absorbers to thin or thick mesoscopic metal oxides and planar heterojunction solar devices.',\n",
       " 'For example, when MAPbI3 was loaded on a mesoporous (mp)-TiO2 electrode by the sequential deposition of PbI2 and methylammonium iodide (MAI), a 15.0% power-conversion efficiency (PCE) was achieved under 1 sun illumination11.',\n",
       " 'The authors of ref.\\xa012 reported a maximum performance of 15.4% efficiency with an open-circuit voltage (Voc) of 1.07 V and short-circuit current density (Jsc) of 21.5 mA cm−2, based on uniform MAPbI3\\xa0−\\xa0xClx planar thin layers deposited by the vacuum thermal evaporation method without the mp-TiO2 electrode.',\n",
       " 'Several other groups also reported efficient planar solar cells, based on normal organic photovoltaic structure12,19.',\n",
       " 'Although very impressive cell efficiencies have been achieved, the cell architecture, use of vacuum, or the two-step deposition process should be modified to improve efficiency and reduce fabrication cost.',\n",
       " 'Spin-coating, one of the cheapest film production methods, is widely used in solution-processed perovskite solar cells.',\n",
       " 'Evaporation and the convective self-assembly process during spinning immediately induce the formation of well-crystallized perovskite materials due to strong ionic interactions between the metal cations and halogen anions.',\n",
       " 'Generally, γ-butyrolactone (GBL), N,N-dimethylformamide, DMSO and N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone are used as effective solvents for lead halides and MAI.',\n",
       " 'However, simple spin-coating did not yield a homogeneous perovskite layer having uniform thickness over a large area20, although the convective spreading flow due to centrifugal force was applied to the slowly evaporating solvents.',\n",
       " 'Previously, we reported the formation of a pillared structure with an island-type upper layer10, and proposed the importance of a homogeneous upper layer on the mp-TiO2 base; however, we were unable to deposit uniform thin films by the solution process.',\n",
       " 'Furthermore, it was reported that the uniformity of the perovskite films depended on the thickness of the TiO2 compact layer, and modification of the spinning conditions could not achieve 100% surface coverage20.',\n",
       " 'This limited the applicability of the solution process.',\n",
       " 'Here, we report the solution-process fabrication of efficient perovskite solar cells comprising a bilayer architecture and MAPb(I1\\xa0−\\xa0xBrx)3 perovskites formed by a solvent-engineering technology.',\n",
       " 'The MAPb(I1\\xa0−\\xa0xBrx)3 perovskite composition was used because the substitution of 10–15 mol% Br− for I− in MAPbI3 greatly improved the stability in ambient atmosphere, and the dual halide material demonstrated similar performance over the compositional range13.',\n",
       " 'When the perovskite was deposited using a mixture of GBL and DMSO, followed by a toluene drip while spinning, extremely uniform and dense layers were formed.',\n",
       " 'This solvent-engineering technology enabled a fully solution-processed perovskite solar cell with a certified 16.2% power-conversion efficiency under standard reporting conditions.',\n",
       " 'Figure\\xa01 presents a schematic diagram of the cell architecture and deposition of perovskite materials by the solvent-engineering technology by means of spin-coating, as well as X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of the resulting coatings.',\n",
       " 'The cell architecture (Fig.\\xa01a) reveals a bilayer structure comprising mesoscopic and planar structures, and is effective for sufficiently absorbing light and collecting charges.',\n",
       " 'Atop the mp-TiO2 layer lies a highly uniform perovskite active layer (100–300 nm thick).',\n",
       " 'Poly(triarylamine) (PTAA) and Au metal were next deposited on the active layer as a hole-transporting material and photocathode, respectively.',\n",
       " 'For this architecture, the formation of a homogeneous thin perovskite layer is extremely important, and we developed our solvent-engineering technology as an effective tool for creating such a layer.',\n",
       " 'The process involves five stages, as depicted in Fig.\\xa01c.',\n",
       " 'First, a mixture of MAI, MABr, PbI2, PbBr2, GBL and DMSO in the appropriate ratio is spread over the entire surface of the substrate.',\n",
       " 'Second, the spin-coater is accelerated to the desired rotational speed and maintained there for several tens of seconds to evaporate the solvent.',\n",
       " 'Third, a solvent that does not dissolve the perovskite materials and is miscible with DMSO and GBL (for example, toluene or chloroform) is dripped on the substrate during spinning.',\n",

      "In pure GBL, the perovskite crystals formed immediately, and the colour of the film on the substrate changed to dark hazy brown during rotation at 5,000 r.p.m, regardless of the application of the toluene drip. 0.0\n",
      "The resulting morphology appears as inhomogeneous islands with low coverage on the substrate (Supplementary Fig. 1a). 0.0\n",

      "The spin-coated layer formed with the solvent mixture followed by the toluene drip is extremely uniform and transparent, and covers the full surface with low surface roughness. 0.0\n",
      "Without the toluene drip treatment, the resulting material adopts a textile-like inhomogeneous layer that does not fully cover the substrate, and perovskite crystals are formed from the coating after annealing at 100 °C (Supplementary Fig. 1b). 0.0\n",

      "Therefore, we think that the phase formed on toluene drop-casting in step 3 of Fig. 1c has a well-developed crystalline form. 0.0\n",
      "To get further information for the phase, we compared it with the XRD patterns for PbI2, MAI and PbI2(DMSO)2, because the constituents in the mixed solvent can be simply precipitated in the non-dissolving solvent. 0.0\n",
      "Here, PbI2 as a layered semiconductor material contains a plane of Pb ions sandwiched between adjacent layers of hexagonally arranged iodide ions. 0.0\n",
      "The interlayer spaces allow rapid intercalation of different guest molecules owing to the weak bonding between the two planes by van der Waals-type interactions, leading to the expansion of the interlayer distance along the c axis21. 0.0\n",
      "It was known that the DMSO used as a solvent in this work can coordinate with lead halide to form a PbI2(DMSO)2 complex22. 0.0\n",
