Among them, the flexible PSCs are especially more widely applicable and may propel the rapid advancements of wearable electronics, causing a significant paradigm shift in consumer electronics. Current flexible PSCs use non-biodegradable petroleum-based polymer substrates, discarding of which will aggravate “white pollution”. Therefore, development of green, biodegradable and low-cost flexible substrates will provide a great alternative to flexible PSCs. Here we have developed transparent nanocellulose paper (NCP) with coating of acrylic resin as substrates to fabricate flexible PSCs, which are biodegradable and easily disposable. The PCE of these NCP-based PSCs reached 4.25%, while the power per weight (the ratio of power to device weight) was as high as 0.56 W g<sup>–1</sup>. The flexible PSCs also showed good stability, retaining &gt;80% of original efficiency after 50 times of bending. The NCP-based substrates can also be applied to other electronic systems, which may prosper next-generation green flexible electronics.</p></abstract><abstract id="Abs2" xml:lang="en"><title>Transparent perovskite solar cells on paper</title><p id="Par2">Modified nanocellulose paper has been shown to be excellent biodegradable substrate for flexible perovskite solar cells and potentially other green flexible devices.

Firstly, NCP was made from viscous solution of nanocellulose of natural cotton<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup> and coated by acrylic resin to form waterproof layer on its surface (step 1–3 of Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). Cotton, as a cellulose-rich low-cost material, was chosen as raw material to fabricate NCP. It is noted that the as-fabricated pure NCP was vulnerable to water and became seriously wrinkled due to the swelling of nanocellulose, which is unfavorable as substrate for flexible electronics, especially flexible PSCs prepared by a fully solution-processed method (e.g., PEDOT:PSS is a water-based reagent). To solve this problem, we coated pure NCP with acrylic resin, a type of plastic usually used in electronics due to its eco-friendly, low-cost, easy-to-handle, highly transparent properties, and appropriate mechanical strength, thermal stability, low surface roughness, and especially excellent waterproof ability. The coating of acrylic resin formed a protective layer on the surface of NCP to protect NCP from water and improved the properties of NCP including transmittance, tensile strength and thermal stability. This treatment allowed for easier handling and manufacturing abilities of NCP-based substrate for subsequent fabrication of flexible PSCs.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Preparation process of NCP-based substrate and NCP-based PSCs.

NCP-based substrate retained stable shape in water so that we could use a typical fully solution-processed method to build PSCs. PEDOT:PSS (PH1000) doped with Triton-X 100 and ethylene glycol was used to fabricate transparent conductive anode on NCP-based substrate by a spin-coating method. The other functional layers including hole transport layer (PEDOT:PSS 4083), photoelectric active layer (perovskite layer) and electron transport layer (PCBM) were constructed by the same spin-coating method.</p><p id="Par9">After usage, flexible PSCs can be disposed easily by flame burning, generating little environmental pollution (step 6 of Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). Because the substrate is a type of cellulose-rich materials, only carbon dioxide and carbon materials were produced from the substrate when the NCP-based PSCs were disposed by flame burning. As for the functional layers of the NCP-based PSCs, their mass fraction was less than 34% of the whole device, which is low as compared to that of the substrate (over 66% of the device), and thus disposal of these functional layers generated little environmental pollution. Finally, the burnt ashes of the NCP-based PSCs could be sent back to natural soil as fertilizer of cotton or other plants to accomplish the green cycle.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Waterproof capacity of NCP-based substrate</title><p id="Par10">To make the NCP waterproof as substrate for flexible PSCs, we have coated pure NCP with a layer of acrylic resin. The thickness of acrylic resin and NCP is about 3.5 μm and 40 μm, respectively (Supplementary Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">6a</xref>), while the weight of 1 cm<sup>2</sup> substrates without and with acrylic resin is 3.31 mg and 4.96 mg, respectively (Supplementary Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">6b</xref>). Contact angle measurement and water-drop test have shown the excellent waterproof capacity of NCP-based substrate (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). During the contact angle measurement, the contact angle of water on pure NCP decreased from 59° to 40° over 65 s (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2a</xref>). After 40 s, the contact angle reached ~40° and kept stable. The reason for descending of the contact angle is that pure NCP absorbed certain amount of water before 40 s due to its swelling property, enhancing hydrophilic ability of NCP. After that, the content of water reached maximum in pure NCP and the contact angle of water kept stable on pure NCP. As for the NCP-based substrate with coating of acrylic resin, the contact angle of water kept stable at ~71° over 50 s (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2b</xref>), which was the same as pure acrylic resin film (Supplementary Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>). The cellulose-based NCP is more hydrophilic than acrylic resin and has shown a lower value of the contact angle of water. Stable contact angle of water on NCP-based substrate as compared to that of pure NCP implies that a protective layer of acrylic resin has been successfully formed on the surface of NCP and water cannot permeate into inner NCP, exhibiting excellent waterproof capacity.<fig id="Fig2"><label>Fig. 2</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Contact angle measurement and water-drop test.

A drop of water (40 μL) was added on their surfaces (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2d</xref>). Then they were dried naturally at room temperature (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2e</xref>). According to the final dry state, pure NCP deformed severely while the NCP-based substrate was still flat and regular. Swelling process of pure NCP rebuilt inner architecture of nanocellulose chains and led to asymmetric distribution of strain force, resulting in severe deformation of pure NCP; on the other hand, the coating layer of acrylic resin prevented permeation of water into the NCP and protected the NCP to remain a stable shape. The coating layer of acrylic resin not only formed a uniform protective layer on the surface of NCP (Supplementary Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">6a</xref>), but also improved the flatness of the surface (Supplementary Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">2</xref>), making the NCP-based substrate excellent for flexible PSCs.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Other properties of NCP-based substrate</title><p id="Par12">In flexible electronics, transmittance, mechanical properties and thermal stability are vital parameters of the substrates, especially for high-performance photoelectric devices.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref></sup> Here, we have characterized these properties of NCP-based substrate through UV–Vis, strain–stress and thermal expansion measurements (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>). The NCP-based substrate has displayed very high transmittance (&gt;90%) in visible light wavelength (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3a</xref>). At the wavelength of 550 nm, transmittance of NCP was 90.70% and transmittance of acrylic resin was 91.79%, while transmittance of the NCP-based substrate with coating of acrylic resin was 91.71%. Especially in wavelength less than 700 nm, NCP-based substrate and acrylic resin revealed higher transmittance than NCP. The reason for this might be that the as-prepared NCP had rough surface due to home-made preparation, which led to a little light scattering. As acrylic resin has higher transmittance than NCP, the coating layer of acrylic resin reduced light scattering and improved luminousness of the NCP-based substrate (see also inset of Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3a</xref>). With the coating of acrylic resin, the mean value of root-mean-square (RMS) surface roughness of NCP decreased from 9.507 to 2.151 nm (Supplementary Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">3</xref>), which indicates that the coating layer of acrylic resin can improve not only the transmittance, but also the smoothness of the NCP-based substrate. Better functional layers of PSCs could be built on smooth substrates due to minimal defect on the surface, which is beneficial for charge transport and collection.<fig id="Fig3"><label>Fig. 3</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Comparison of NCP and NCP-based substrate with coating of acrylic resin. <bold>a</bold> Transmittance, <bold>b</bold> strain–stress curve, and <bold>c</bold> coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE) of NCP, NCP-based substrate and acrylic resin film.

From the strain-stress curve (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3b</xref>), we can see that tensile strength and Young’s modulus of pure NCP were 62.8 MPa and 3.5 GPa, while those of acrylic resin were 52.5 MPa and 0.8 GPa, smaller than those of NCP. Noteworthy, tensile strength and Young’s modulus of the NCP-based substrate with coating of acrylic resin were 81 MPa and 4.9 GPa, which increased about 28.9 and 40% compared to NCP (about 54.3 and 512.5% compared to pure acrylic resin film). When coating acrylic resin on NCP, the solution of acrylic resin was filled into nanostructured architectures of the NCP to form a protecting layer on its surface, resulting in better tensile strength and Young’s modulus of NCP-based substrate. It is clear that coating of acrylic resin on NCP has greatly improved its mechanical properties, which offers NCP-based substrate with appropriate mechanical properties for building flexible PSCs.</p><p id="Par14">Finally, the NCP-based substrate has shown outstanding thermal stability. The coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE) of acrylic resin was very high, which reached 217 ppm K<sup>–1</sup> (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3c</xref>). Thus the film of acrylic resin experienced large transformation of shape during heating process, which is unfavorable for preparation of flexible electronics, e.g., being annealed at high temperature (&gt;100 °C) during fabrication. On the other hand, pure NCP had low CTE, which was only 12.7 ppm K<sup>–1</sup>. The CTE of the NCP-based substrate was 26.7 ppm K<sup>–1</sup>, which is much lower than that of acrylic resin and many other polymers. The low CTE of the NCP-based substrate demonstrates its superb thermal-mechanical property in heating process for fabrication of flexible electronics. Moreover, NCP and NCP-based substrate with coating of acrylic resin exhibited excellent heat resistance as compared to common PET (165 °C), which remained stable up to 310 °C and 294 °C, respectively (Supplementary Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">4</xref>). While the coating layer of acrylic resin improved the waterproof capacity, transmittance, smoothness, and mechanical properties of the NCP-based substrate, NCP made the NCP-based substrate have less thermal expansion and better heat resistance. Moreover, both NCP and NCP-based substrate with acrylic resin revealed excellent flexibility, with no cracks observed on the surface of these substrates after 1000 bending cycles (bending angle is 180°) (Supplementary Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">7</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Performance of NCP-based PSCs</title><p id="Par15">We have successfully fabricated flexible PSCs on the NCP-based substrate (inset of Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4b</xref>). The planar heterojunction PSCs were structured as doped PEDOT:PSS anode (40 nm)/PEDOT:PSS 4083 (30 nm)/Perovskite (350 nm)/PCBM (100 nm)/Al (100 nm) (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4a</xref>).

The high incident photon-to-electron conversion efficiency (IPCE) over the whole visible spectrum confirmed the high current density of 17.68 mA cm<sup>–2</sup> (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4d</xref>). Good reproducibility was achieved with a typical value of over 3% for more than 80% of the devices (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4e</xref>). The NCP-based PSCs have presented good stability after 50 times of bending with a curvature diameter of 15 mm, retaining &gt;80% of its original efficiency (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4f</xref>). The efficiency decreasing with bending cycles is probably due to the cracks of perovskite layer formed during the bending cycles (Supplementary Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">8</xref>). These cracks could hinder the mobility of carrier and deteriorate the performance of device. In addition, the reference PSCs without bending have shown better stability, more than 90% of the original PCE after 25 measurements (Supplementary Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">9</xref>), which also suggests that the efficiency decreasing is probably due to these cracks of perovskite layer rather than other factors (e.g., the humidity of environment). The PCE of NCP-based flexible PSCs was close to earlier value of flexible PSCs (6% on polymer substrate),<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref></sup> nevertheless poor as compared to recent high-efficiency flexible PSCs (over 12% on polymer substrate)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref></sup> (Supplementary Table <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref></sup>; the power per weight reached 0.56 W g<sup>–1</sup> due to the lightweight and thin NCP-based substrate, which was comparable to high-performance PSCs on ultrathin flexible substrate (1.96 W g<sup>–1</sup>).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref></sup> Some of these parameters were relatively low probably due to the poor electrical conductivity of transparent electrode made from doped PEDOT:PSS and the un-optimized preparation process of the PSCs. The performance of the NCP-based PSCs could be further improved by doping other materials (e.g., silver nanowires, graphene, carbon nanotubes, and other nano-materials) in transparent electrode and optimizing the preparation process (e.g., the spinning speed of spin-coating method, annealed temperature, and number of coating layer), which are underway.<fig id="Fig4"><label>Fig. 4</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Device performance of NCP-based PSCs. <bold>a</bold> The device structure of perovskite planar heterojunction solar cells. <bold>b</bold> Current density-voltage (J-V) characterization of MAPbI<sub>3</sub> devices.
