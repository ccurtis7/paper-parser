       "<p class=\"cde-paragraph\">Solar cells were fabricated on precleaned ITO-coated glass substrates with a sheet resistance of 20 Ω sq−1. First, a thin ZnO nanoparticle layer was spin coated onto the substrate at 3,000 r.p.m. for 30 s. The procedure was repeated three times to obtain a continuous smooth film. A PbI2 solution (dissolved in N,N-dimethylformamide at a concentration of 460 mg ml−1) was then spin coated on top of the ZnO layer at 3,000 r.p.m. for 15 s. After drying for several minutes in air, the substrate was dipped into a solution of CH3NH3I in 2-propanol (10 mg ml−1) for 40 s, then dried under a flow of clean air. Subsequently, the spiro-OMeTAD-based hole-transfer layer (80 mg spiro-OMeTAD, 28.5 µl 4-tert-butylpyridine and 17.5 µl lithium-bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide (Li-TFSI) solution (520 mg Li-TFSI in 1 ml acetonitrile) all dissolved in 1 ml chlorobenzene) was deposited by spin coating at 4,000 r.p.m. for 30 s. Finally, a 150-nm-thick silver layer was deposited by thermal evaporation at a base pressure of 2 × 10−6 mbar. The completed devices were stored in a N2-purged glovebox (<0.1 ppm O2 and H2O). Prior to the evaporation of the Ag top contact, all device fabrication steps were carried out under ambient conditions.</p>"
