       "<p class=\"cde-paragraph\">Organic–inorganic hybrid solar cells that combine a mesoporous scaffold, a perovskite light absorber and an organic hole transporter have emerged at the forefront of solution-processable photovoltaic devices; however, they require processing temperatures of up to 500 °C to sinter the mesoporous metal-oxide support. Here, we report the use of a thin film of ZnO nanoparticles as an electron-transport layer in CH3NH3PbI3-based solar cells; in contrast to mesoporous TiO2, the ZnO layer is both substantially thinner and requires no sintering. We took advantage of these facts to prepare flexible solar cells with power-conversion efficiencies in excess of 10%. The use of ZnO also results in improvements to device performance for cells prepared on rigid substrates. Solar cells based on this design exhibit power-conversion efficiencies as high as 15.7% when measured under AM1.5G illumination, which makes them some of the highest-performing perovskite solar cells reported to date.</p>\n",

       "<p class=\"cde-paragraph\">Research in the area of solution-processable solar cells has led to substantial progress in the development of both organic and hybrid photovoltaic devices, with power-conversion efficiencies (PCEs) now routinely approaching or exceeding 10%. This progress has been driven by the synthesis of new electron-donor materials (both polymers and small-molecule chromophores) for organic photovoltaic (OPV) devices1,2,3, and the preparation of new dyes and redox mediators for dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs)4,5. Despite these advances, the efficiencies of both OPV and DSSC devices are inherently limited by losses associated with the thermodynamic driving force required to either dissociate a strongly bound exciton or drive electron-transfer processes in a DSSC. One exciting alternative to these traditional device architectures is the hybrid organic–inorganic devices that utilize perovskite-based materials as the light-absorbing component6. Early work utilized very small CH3NH3PbI3 nanoparticles to sensitize TiO2, and produced PCEs of 3–4%7; however, since then advances in cell design have led to remarkably rapid improvements in device efficiency8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20. State-of-the-art perovskite solar cells based on a mesoporous titanium dioxide scaffold, a CH3NH3PbI3 light-absorption layer and a 2,2′,7,7′-tetrakis-(N,N-di-p-methoxyphenylamine)-9,9′-bifluorene (spiro-OMeTAD) hole transport layer have achieved PCEs as high as 15.0%21, and several reports suggest that solar cells with efficiencies up to 20% are realistically achievable6,22.</p>\n",
       "<p class=\"cde-paragraph\">Currently, most state-of-the-art perovskite-based devices utilize a mesoporous metal-oxide scaffold to provide a porous substrate on which the CH3NH3PbI3 light absorber can be grown. In addition to acting as a structure-directing support, the titania scaffolds are also responsible for accepting electrons from the absorber and transporting them to the electrode surface20,21. Although relatively thin compared to the mesoporous TiO2 films traditionally used in liquid electrolyte DSSCs (350 nm versus ∼10 µm in a traditional DSSC), these layers are, nonetheless, substantially thicker than the electron-transport layers typically utilized in inverted OPV devices (40 nm)23,24; in addition, the mesoporous films require sintering at 450–550 °C prior to use, which renders them incompatible with flexible substrates. Recently, Snaith and co-workers demonstrated that the high efficiency of perovskite-based devices could be maintained or further improved by replacing the titania mesoporous scaffold with an insulating Al2O3 analogue25,26, and that the Al2O3 matrix could be constructed at lower temperatures (110–150 °C) than those required for mesoporous TiO2 (refs 27,28). Further work has demonstrated that perovskite solar cells with up to 15.4% efficiency can be produced in the absence of a mesoporous matrix by a vapour-phase deposition process29, and efficiencies up to 11.4% have been achieved using solution-phase approaches30. Motivated by the desire to simplify further the processing of these perovskite-based solar cells, we investigated the use of a relatively compact electron-transport layer based on ZnO nanoparticles as an alternative to both the mesoporous TiO2 (ref. 21) and Al2O3 (ref. 25) scaffolds and vapour-phase deposition approaches29 reported previously. ZnO is known to have an electron mobility that is substantially higher than that of TiO2 (ref. 31), which makes it an ideal choice for an electron-selective contact. Additionally, the ZnO nanoparticle layer can be deposited easily by spin coating and requires no heating or sintering step, which makes it ideal for deposition on thermally sensitive substrates. Devices based on this design performed extremely well, with PCEs reaching 15.7% when illuminated and tested under standard AM1.5G conditions. Flexible devices could also be prepared by this method, and displayed PCEs over 10%. The solution-processing of the ZnO layer is simple, economical and proceeds at room temperature, which gives it important advantages over other cell designs that use mesoporous scaffolds21,25 or vapour-phase deposition techniques29.</p>\n",
       "<p class=\"cde-paragraph\">The ZnO nanoparticles used in the fabrication of the electron-selective contacts were prepared by the hydrolysis of zinc acetate in methanol32,33. This process produces crystalline nanoparticles that are approximately 5 nm in diameter, as determined by transmission electron microscopy (TEM; Supplementary Fig. 1). The nanoparticles are dispersed readily in butanol/chloroform mixtures with no additional surfactants or binders; as such, after they are spin coated onto the indium tin oxide (ITO) substrate, no calcination or sintering step is required. This process produces a relatively compact ZnO layer, the thickness of which can be varied systematically by repeating the spin-coating process several times. A two-step process was then used to grow the CH3NH3PbI3 layer21. This consisted of spin coating a layer of PbI2 onto the ZnO surface, followed by immersion of the substrate in a solution of CH3NH3I. The efficiency of the subsequent devices was found to vary with CH3NH3I concentration, solution temperature and dipping time, and care was taken to ensure that the processing conditions were reproduced as consistently as possible. Spin coating of the spiro-OMeTAD hole-transport material and thermal evaporation of the Ag top contact completes the device structure (Fig. 1a). The CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite is a direct, low-bandgap semiconductor with good carrier mobility; based on the relative energy levels of the various device components (Fig. 1b), free charge carriers (or excitons) generated in the CH3NH3PbI3 layer can be extracted (or dissociated) by either transferring an electron to the underlying ZnO layer, or through hole transfer to the spiro-OMeTAD hole-transport material. Given the highly selective nature of both the ZnO and spiro-OMeTAD layers, this is expected to lead to highly efficient devices with good fill factors.</p>\n",

       "</figure>\n",
       "<p class=\"cde-paragraph\">To probe the effect of ZnO layer thickness on device performance, devices were prepared by spin coating zero, one, three, five and eight layers of ZnO nanoparticles (Table 1). This produced electron-transport layers that varied from 0 to 70 nm in thickness. As can be seen from the data, the presence of an efficient electron-transport layer is crucial to obtain high-performance devices. Without the ZnO layer, the fill factor and open-circuit voltage (Voc) are very low because of increased recombination at the ITO surface and a correspondingly low shunt resistance. Incorporating even a very thin (10 nm) ZnO layer into the device substantially improves both the Voc and the fill factor, and for a ZnO thickness of 25 nm, PCEs in excess of 14% were obtained. Further increases in the thickness of the ZnO layer did not result in any improvements in device performance.</p>\n",

       "<caption class=\"cde-caption\">Table 1: Device parameters for solar cells prepared with varying thicknesses of ZnO.</caption>\n",
       "</figure>\n",
       "<p class=\"cde-paragraph\">To ensure the reproducibility of the results, over 100 separate devices were fabricated and tested using the optimized ZnO thickness of 25 nm. Histograms of the cell-performance characteristics are shown in Fig. 2, and the average device parameters are tabulated in Supplementary Table 1. As can be seen from the results, the devices performed extremely well. The Voc values were highly reproducible and in excess of 1.0 V, and the average short-circuit current density (Jsc) was nearly 20 mA cm−2. When combined with the very good fill factors (>70%), this produced an average PCE of 13.7%. Both the reproducibility of the device fabrication procedure (a 7.6% relative standard deviation in PCE) and the excellent PCEs are highly encouraging. Clearly, both our results and those of Liu et al.29 indicate that the mesoporous scaffolds utilized in other device architectures are superfluous for the production of high-performance cells. Furthermore, not only is the average PCE reported here (13.7%) substantially higher than the equivalent average PCE for solution-processed planar-junction devices reported in the literature (≤9%)29,30, but also it is noticeably higher than even those devices constructed using high-vacuum vapour-phase deposition techniques (12.3%)29.</p>\n",

       "</figure>\n",
       "<p class=\"cde-paragraph\">The current–voltage (J–V) characteristics and incident photon-to-current efficiency (IPCE) spectrum of the highest-performing device is shown in Fig. 3. From the J–V curve measured under standard AM1.5G illumination, the Jsc, Voc, fill factor and PCE were determined as 20.4 mA cm−2, 1.03 V, 74.9% and 15.7%, respectively. The very high PCE of 15.7% makes this device one of the highest-performing solution-processed cells reported to date, which is especially remarkable given the complete lack of a mesoporous scaffold and any high-temperature processing steps. The IPCE spectrum shows the expected behaviour for a high-performance device based on CH3NH3PbI3. The onset of photocurrent at 800 nm is consistent with the reported bandgap of CH3NH3PbI3 (ref. 34), and the efficiency of 75–80% obtained across almost the entire spectrum (360–750 nm) highlights the excellent performance of the device. Based on the absorption spectrum of a representative CH3NH3PbI3 film (Supplementary Fig. 2), the light-harvesting efficiency of the devices is estimated to be >95% below 650 nm and ∼85% between 650 and 750 nm, which implies a high internal quantum efficiency (absorbed photon-to-current efficiency). Integrating the product of the AM1.5G photon flux with the IPCE spectrum yields a predicted Jsc of 19.4 mA cm−2, which is in agreement with the measured value of 20.4 mA cm−2.</p>\n",
       "<figure>\n",
       "<caption class=\"cde-caption\">Figure 3: J–V curves and IPCE spectrum of the highest-performing device in this study.</caption>\n",
       "</figure>\n",
       "<p class=\"cde-paragraph\">The origin of the high performances observed in the ITO/ZnO/CH3NH3PbI3/spiro-OMeTAD/Ag devices was investigated further by studying the morphologies of the various layers of the device stack. Although the relative proportion of photogenerated free-charge carriers versus excitons is unknown, previous reports proposed that charge extraction and/or exciton dissociation occurs predominantly at the mesoporous TiO2/CH3NH3PbI3 interface20,21. However, the ZnO nanoparticle film utilized in the current study is quite compact, with little surface roughness or porosity visible under the scanning electron microscope (SEM; see Supplementary Fig. 3). As such, the cells prepared in this study more closely resemble those of Liu et al.29, in which a compact TiO2 layer served as the electron-selective contact; in these cells, there is also very limited interfacial surface area between the electron-selective contact and the perovskite absorber. Given the high efficiencies of both our devices and the planar heterojunctions of Liu et al.29, carrier collection at the ZnO/CH3NH3PbI3 interface clearly does not limit the overall photocurrent. In the case of the planar heterojunctions, this can be understood on the basis of the very long electron–hole diffusion lengths of the mixed halide CH3NH3PbI3–xClx perovskites employed (on the order of 1 µm)35; as the diffusion lengths are substantially greater than the absorption depth of the material, the planar heterojunction structure does not affect the PCE detrimentally. In contrast, for the pure iodide-based perovskite used in the present work, the electron–hole diffusion lengths are only on the order of 100 nm (refs 35,36), which is substantially lower than the CH3NH3PbI3 film thickness (∼300 nm). Therefore, the interfacial surface area between the perovskite and the hole-transport material is of substantial importance. The surface of the ITO/ZnO/CH3NH3PbI3 layer is shown in Fig. 4, which reveals the formation of large (100–1,000 nm) crystallites of CH3NH3PbI3 that were not present in the PbI2 precursor film (Supplementary Fig. 4).</p>\n",
       "<figure>\n",
       "<caption class=\"cde-caption\">Figure 4: SEM micrographs of the ITO/ZnO/CH3NH3PbI3 film.</caption>\n",
       "</figure>\n",
       "<p class=\"cde-paragraph\">We propose that in the absence of a mesoporous scaffold, perovskite crystal growth is relatively unconstrained during the immersion of the PbI2-coated film in the CH3NH3I solution. This is supported by powder X-ray diffraction measurements (Supplementary Fig. 5). The data are consistent with the tetragonal phase of CH3NH3PbI3 (ref. 34) and, most importantly, the relative sharpness of the peaks is indicative of the large crystallite size. Analysis of the peak full-width-half-maxima via the Debye–Scherrer equation provides an estimated crystallite size of 75 nm. Given that this represents a lower bound on the crystallite size, the data are in quite reasonable agreement with the smaller particles observed in the SEM images. The increased crystallite size results in a highly roughened CH3NH3PbI3/spiro-OMeTAD interface; importantly, the crystallite size is commensurate with the electron–hole diffusion lengths in CH3NH3PbI3, and thus ensures a high level of carrier extraction from the perovskite film. The large crystallite size may also serve to increase the carrier mobility within the CH3NH3PbI3 layer and reduce recombination from defect and trap states. These factors, at least in part, explain the high Jsc values and fill factors observed in the present study; however, to achieve the very high Jsc values of the highest-performing cells (>20 mA cm−2), additional factors must also be considered. Previous reports of CH3NH3PbI3-based cells all focused on the use of compact TiO2 electron-transport layers21,25,29,30; however, many studies show that ZnO has a substantially higher electron mobility than TiO2 (ref. 31). The higher electron mobility may help contribute to the observed increase in Jsc. Additionally, the large crystallites observed at the surface of the CH3NH3PbI3 layer act as scattering centres for the incoming light, which efficiently re-directs it off-normal and thereby increases the effective optical path length of the device. The non-zero absorbance at sub-bandgap wavelengths (800 nm) in Supplementary Fig. 2 is consistent with scattering from the CH3NH3PbI3 film. The contributions of all of these factors (efficient carrier collection and/or exciton dissociation, improved mobility within the electron-transport layer and extensive light scattering) probably give rise to the high photocurrents that are observed.</p>\n",
       "<p class=\"cde-paragraph\">One of the main advantages in the use of the ZnO nanoparticle layer is that no sintering or annealing step is required. The other major fabrication steps (spin coating of PbI2, soaking in CH3NH3I solution and spin coating of spiro-OMeTAD) are also carried out by solution-processing techniques at room temperature, which means this fabrication process is ideal for the preparation of devices on flexible substrates. The ITO/glass substrate was therefore replaced with thin films of ITO/poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET), and a number of devices were fabricated using the same preparation procedures. The results of this study are shown in Fig. 5.</p>\n",
       "<figure>\n",
       "<caption class=\"cde-caption\">Figure 5: Device performance, IPCE spectrum, photograph and bending tests for a device prepared on a flexible PET substrate.</caption>\n",
       "</figure>\n",
       "<p class=\"cde-paragraph\">As can be seen from Fig. 5, the devices on ITO/PET substrates performed reasonably well. The J–V curve of the highest-performing device on a flexible substrate is shown in Fig. 5a, which yields a Voc of 1.03 V, a Jsc of 13.4 mA cm−2, a fill factor of 73.9% and a PCE of 10.2%. Although lower than the efficiency of devices fabricated on ITO/glass substrates (primarily because of the lower Jsc), the successful combination of device flexibility and a PCE > 10% is highly promising. Some insight into the lower Jsc can be gained from the IPCE spectrum (Fig. 5b). In contrast to the broad, flat IPCE spectrum observed on rigid substrates (Fig. 3b), the IPCE spectrum of the device fabricated on PET displays a broad peak at 450 nm with a pronounced shoulder at 680 nm. This leads to a substantial loss of photocurrent in the 500–800 nm range, as compared to the devices fabricated on glass. Bending tests show that the device performs well even after being bent repeatedly to decreasing radii of curvature (Fig. 5d). We decreased the radius of curvature to the point where the ITO/PET substrate could no longer recover its shape and observed less than a 15% drop in efficiency. Importantly, our results suggest that the flexibility of the device is limited by the flexibility of the ITO/PET substrate, and not by the perovskite layer. Therefore, although the flexible devices have lower efficiencies than those prepared on rigid substrates, this is a substantial step forward in the development of hybrid organic–inorganic solar cells. Flexible devices are especially attractive for a variety of consumer-driven applications, such as power-generating fabrics, clothing and textiles37. To the best of our knowledge, there is only one other report of a flexible perovskite solar cell38, and no reports of a flexible perovskite device with a PCE over 10%.</p>\n",
       "<p class=\"cde-paragraph\">We have developed ZnO nanoparticle electron-transport layers for CH3NH3PbI3-based solar cells, and demonstrated that neither a mesoporous scaffold nor any high-temperature processing steps are required to achieve PCEs as high as 15.7%. This is expected to simplify dramatically the device fabrication procedures for such devices, but at the same time maintain or improve their already-high device efficiency. The high performance of these cells appears to originate from the unconstrained crystallite growth that occurs in the absence of a mesoporous scaffold. Large crystallites of CH3NH3PbI3 lead to a highly textured CH3NH3PbI3/spiro-OMeTAD interface, the dimensions of which are commensurate with the electron–hole diffusion lengths. The crystallites also act as efficient light scattering centres, which increases the effective optical path length of the device. The combination of these effects leads to values of Jsc greater than 20 mA cm−2. Flexible devices on ITO/PET substrates can also be prepared by this route, and display PCEs in excess of 10%. This combination of ease-of-fabrication, room-temperature processing, high device performance and device flexibility are all expected to help push these hybrid organic–inorganic solar cells closer to commercial viability.</p>\n",

       "<p class=\"cde-paragraph\">ZnO nanoparticles were prepared according to literature procedures32,33. Zinc acetate dihydrate (2.95 g, 13.4 mmol) was dissolved in methanol (125 ml) with stirring at 65 °C. A solution of KOH (1.48 g, 23 mmol) in methanol (65 ml) was then added dropwise at 60–65 °C over a period of 15 min. The reaction mixture was stirred for 2.5 h at 65 °C. After cooling to room temperature, the supernatant was decanted and the precipitate washed twice with methanol (20 ml). n-butanol (70 ml), methanol (5 ml) and chloroform (5 ml) were added to disperse the precipitate and produce a ZnO nanoparticle solution with a concentration of 6 mg ml−1. Before use, the ZnO nanoparticle solution was filtered through a 0.45 µm PVDF syringe filter.</p>\n",
       "<h2 class=\"cde-title\">Solar cell fabrication</h2>\n",
       "<p class=\"cde-paragraph\">Solar cells were fabricated on precleaned ITO-coated glass substrates with a sheet resistance of 20 Ω sq−1. First, a thin ZnO nanoparticle layer was spin coated onto the substrate at 3,000 r.p.m. for 30 s. The procedure was repeated three times to obtain a continuous smooth film. A PbI2 solution (dissolved in N,N-dimethylformamide at a concentration of 460 mg ml−1) was then spin coated on top of the ZnO layer at 3,000 r.p.m. for 15 s. After drying for several minutes in air, the substrate was dipped into a solution of CH3NH3I in 2-propanol (10 mg ml−1) for 40 s, then dried under a flow of clean air. Subsequently, the spiro-OMeTAD-based hole-transfer layer (80 mg spiro-OMeTAD, 28.5 µl 4-tert-butylpyridine and 17.5 µl lithium-bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide (Li-TFSI) solution (520 mg Li-TFSI in 1 ml acetonitrile) all dissolved in 1 ml chlorobenzene) was deposited by spin coating at 4,000 r.p.m. for 30 s. Finally, a 150-nm-thick silver layer was deposited by thermal evaporation at a base pressure of 2 × 10−6 mbar. The completed devices were stored in a N2-purged glovebox (<0.1 ppm O2 and H2O). Prior to the evaporation of the Ag top contact, all device fabrication steps were carried out under ambient conditions.</p>\n",
       "<h2 class=\"cde-title\">Device characterization</h2>\n",
       "<p class=\"cde-paragraph\">The current–voltage curves of solar cells were measured inside the glovebox using a Keithley 2400 source-measure unit. The cells were illuminated by a 450 W Class AAA solar simulator equipped with an AM1.5G filter (Sol3A, Oriel Instruments) at a calibrated intensity of 100 mW cm−2, as determined by a standard silicon reference cell (91150V, Oriel Instruments). The effective area of the cell was defined as 0.07065 cm2 using a non-reflective metal mask. IPCE spectra were measured in air using a commercial IPCE set-up (QE-PV-Si, Oriel Instruments). Monochromated light was chopped at a frequency of 8 Hz and photocurrents measured using a lock-in amplifier.</p>\n",
