    "Solar cells containing 1 display PCEs up to 4.73 %. Though devices containing 2 have exceeded PCEs of 15 %,2a–2c their moisture sensitivity remains a concern for large‐scale device fabrication or their long‐term use. The layered structure of 1 aids the formation of high‐quality films that show greater moisture resistance compared to 2. The larger bandgap of 1 also affords a higher VOC value of 1.18 V compared to devices with 2. Further improvements in material structure and device engineering, including making appropriate electronic contact with the anisotropic inorganic sheets, should increase the PCEs of these devices. In particular, higher values of n as single‐phase materials or as mixtures may allow for lower bandgaps and higher carrier mobility in the inorganic layers while the organic layers provide additional tunability. For example, hydrophobic fluorocarbons could increase moisture stability, conjugated organic layers could facilitate charge transport, and organic photosensitizers could improve the absorption properties of the material. We are focused on manipulating this extraordinarily versatile platform through synthetic design."
